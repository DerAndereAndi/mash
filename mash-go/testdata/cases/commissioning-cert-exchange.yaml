# Test Cases: Commissioning Certificate Exchange
# Verifies certificate exchange flow after PASE handshake completes

---
id: TC-COMM-002
name: Certificate Exchange After PASE
description: |
  Verifies that after successful PASE handshake, the controller and device
  perform certificate exchange:

  1. Controller sends CertRenewalRequest with Zone CA certificate
  2. Device generates new key pair and sends CSR
  3. Controller signs CSR, assigns device ID, embeds in cert CommonName
  4. Device receives operational cert, extracts device ID from CommonName
  5. Device stores operational cert and Zone CA for future verification

  This follows the Matter pattern where the commissioner assigns the Node ID
  and embeds it in the certificate subject during signing.

pics_requirements:
  - D.COMM.SC          # Device supports secure connection
  - D.COMM.PASE        # Device supports PASE commissioning

id: TC-COMM-003
name: Device ID Consistency After Commissioning
description: |
  Verifies that the device ID is consistent across:
  - Certificate CommonName (source of truth)
  - Device service state
  - mDNS operational advertisement (DI TXT record)

  The controller assigns the device ID during cert signing by computing
  SHA-256(CSR public key)[0:8] and embedding it in the certificate's
  CommonName. The device extracts this value rather than re-deriving it.

pics_requirements:
  - D.COMM.SC          # Device supports secure connection
  - D.DISC.OP          # Device supports operational discovery

preconditions:
  - device_commissioned: true

  Verifies that when a device is commissioned to multiple zones,
  it has a different device ID in each zone (because each zone
  issues a different operational certificate with a different key pair).
