## 1. Overview

MASH devices can belong to multiple controller zones simultaneously. Each zone operates independently with its own certificates, connection, and priority level. This enables scenarios where a grid operator and a home energy manager both control the same device without conflicting.

**Key properties:**
- Maximum 5 zones per device
- Each zone has a dedicated TLS connection
- Zone priority determines conflict resolution
- Zones are independent -- adding or removing one zone does not affect others

---

## 2. Zone Types and Priority

Zone types define the purpose and priority of a controller. Higher priority (lower number) takes precedence in conflict resolution.

| Zone Type | Priority | Typical Owner | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------------|---------|
| GRID_OPERATOR | 1 (highest) | DSO, SMGW, utility | Regulatory/grid control |
| BUILDING_MANAGER | 2 | Building EMS | Commercial building management |
| HOME_MANAGER | 3 | Residential EMS | Home energy optimization |
| USER_APP | 4 (lowest) | Phone apps | User preferences, monitoring |

```

Priority is **per-feature**, not global. The SMGW has priority for power limits but does not override the EMS's charging mode preference.

## 3. Zone Roles

Each zone has three roles that define what entities can do within the zone:

| Role | Capabilities | Typical Entity |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Zone Owner** | Holds Zone CA private key, issues certs, adds/removes members | EMS, SMGW |
| **Zone Admin** | Can commission devices on behalf of owner (forwards CSRs) | Phone App, installer tool |
| **Zone Member** | Has operational cert, communicates with other zone members | Devices (EVSE, inverter, etc.) |

**Key design principles:**

- **Apps are admins, NOT owners.** Losing a phone does not break zone operations. The EMS retains the Zone CA and can issue new admin tokens.
- **Apps always need an EMS.** There are no standalone app zones. An app commissions devices into an EMS-owned zone.
- **Multiple admins are supported.** Family members, installers, and service tools can all be zone admins concurrently.

## 4. Commissioning Flows

### 4.1 Direct Commissioning (EMS → Device)

The standard flow where an EMS directly commissions a device. See [Security: Commissioning](security.md#4-commissioning-pase-like).

### 4.2 Admin Authorization (Adding a Phone App)

```
User             Phone App           EMS Web UI
 │                   │                   │
 │── "Add admin" ────┼──────────────────►│
 │◄── Temp QR (5min) ┼───────────────────┤
 │── Scan QR ───────►│── SPAKE2+ ───────►│
 │◄── "Confirm?" ────┼───────────────────┤
 │── Yes ────────────┼──────────────────►│
 │                   │◄── Admin token ───┤
```

The EMS generates a temporary QR code (valid 5 minutes). The phone app scans it, completes SPAKE2+ with the EMS, and receives an admin token allowing it to commission devices.

### 4.3 App Commissioning Device (as Admin)

```
Phone App              EMS                 Device
    │                   │                    │
    │── SPAKE2+ ───────┼───────────────────►│  (app has setup code)
    │◄─────────────────┼───────── CSR ──────┤
    │── Forward CSR ──►│                    │
    │◄── Signed cert ──┤                    │
    │── Install cert ──┼───────────────────►│  (device in EMS zone)
```

The app performs SPAKE2+ with the device, receives the CSR, forwards it to the EMS for signing, and installs the signed certificate on the device.

### 4.4 Delegated Commissioning via SMGW

For grid operator zones, commissioning is delegated through a backend:

```
User           Phone App       DSO Backend       SMGW          Device
 │                 │               │               │              │
 │── Scan QR ─────►│── Upload ────►│── Forward ───►│              │
 │                 │               │               │── SPAKE2+ ──►│
 │                 │               │               │◄── Accept ───┤
```

1. User scans device QR code with app
2. App uploads setup info to DSO backend
3. DSO backend forwards to appropriate SMGW
4. SMGW commissions device directly
5. User is notified of success

See [Security: Delegated Commissioning](security.md#9-delegated-commissioning) for full details.

## 5. Priority Resolution

When multiple zones set conflicting values, the device resolves conflicts using two rules:

```
LIMITS:    Most restrictive wins (all zones constrain together)
SETPOINTS: Highest priority zone wins (only one controller active)
```

### 5.1 Limit Resolution

All zone limits are applied simultaneously. The most restrictive (lowest) value wins:

```
SMGW sets consumptionLimit = 6000W (priority 1)
EMS sets consumptionLimit = 8000W (priority 3)
→ Effective limit: min(6000, 8000) = 6000W
→ EMS is notified that its limit was overridden
```

Phase current limits are resolved per-phase:

```
Zone 1: SetCurrentLimits({A: 20000, B: 20000, C: 20000}, CONSUMPTION)
Zone 2: SetCurrentLimits({A: 16000, B: 10000, C: 16000}, CONSUMPTION)
→ Effective: {A: 16000, B: 10000, C: 16000} (per-phase minimum)
```

### 5.2 Setpoint Resolution

Only the highest-priority zone's setpoint is active:

```
SMGW (priority 1): SetSetpoint(consumptionSetpoint: 3000000)
EMS (priority 3):  SetSetpoint(consumptionSetpoint: 5000000)
→ Effective setpoint: 3000000 mW (SMGW wins)
```

### 5.3 Combined Resolution

Limits always constrain setpoints:

```
effectiveConsumptionLimit = 5000W (from limit resolution)
effectiveConsumptionSetpoint = 7000W (from setpoint resolution)
→ Device targets: min(7000, 5000) = 5000W (limit caps setpoint)
```

### 5.4 V2H Phase Balancing Example

A worked example showing multi-zone coordination for V2H phase balancing:

```
Scenario: House consumption L1=20A, L2=5A, L3=12A at 230V
          Grid limit 25A per phase
          EMS wants EV to discharge asymmetrically to balance

1. Grid operator sets limit:
   SetCurrentLimits({A: 25000, B: 25000, C: 25000}, PRODUCTION)

2. Home EMS sets asymmetric discharge setpoint:
   SetCurrentSetpoints({A: 10000, B: 2000, C: 5000}, PRODUCTION)
   cause: PHASE_BALANCING

3. V2H EV receives:
   effectiveCurrentLimitsProduction = {A: 25000, B: 25000, C: 25000}
   effectiveCurrentSetpointsProduction = {A: 10000, B: 2000, C: 5000}

4. EV discharges: 10A on L1, 2A on L2, 5A on L3
   Result: Net house import = L1: 10A, L2: 3A, L3: 7A (balanced)
```

## 6. Connection Model

Each zone gets one persistent TCP/TLS connection to the device. The total connection capacity is bounded:

| Connection Type | Maximum | Description |
|-----------------|---------|-------------|
| Operational | max_zones (default: 5) | One persistent connection per paired zone |
| Commissioning | 1 | Single concurrent commissioning attempt |
| **Total** | max_zones + 1 | Maximum simultaneous connections |

**Rules:**
- When all zone slots are filled, the device does not advertise as commissionable
- Operational connections from existing zones are never blocked by commissioning
- User physical override (button on device) is always possible regardless of zone state

See [Transport](transport.md) for TLS configuration and connection management details.

---

## 7. Failsafe Behavior

When a zone's connection is lost, the device transitions to `FAILSAFE` state for that zone:

1. Device detects connection loss (TCP/TLS layer)
2. Device applies `failsafeConsumptionLimit` and `failsafeProductionLimit`
3. Device reports `controlState = FAILSAFE`
4. After `failsafeDuration` expires (2-24 hours), device transitions to `AUTONOMOUS`
5. Device can resume normal operation without controller

**Key design points:**
- Failsafe limits are pre-configured per device (set during commissioning or by the device)
- `failsafeDuration` is shared between consumption and production (one value for both)
- Other zones' connections and limits are unaffected by one zone's connection loss

For detailed timing requirements, see [Failsafe Timing](testing/behavior/failsafe-timing.md).

## 8. Zone Lifecycle

### 8.1 Adding a Zone

1. Controller commissions device (via PASE or delegated commissioning)
2. Device receives operational certificate signed by zone's CA
3. Device allocates a zone slot with the zone's priority
4. Controller establishes operational TLS connection
5. Device reports `controlState = CONTROLLED`

### 8.2 Removing a Zone

1. Controller sends RemoveZone command
2. Device deletes operational certificate for that zone
3. Connection is closed
4. Zone slot is freed (device may re-advertise as commissionable)
5. Device re-evaluates effective limits/setpoints from remaining zones

### 8.3 Zone Slot Exhaustion

When all zone slots are filled:
- Device stops advertising `_mashc._udp` (commissioning service)
- Device rejects commissioning connections at TLS level
- Existing operational connections continue normally
- A zone must be removed before a new one can be added

For detailed state machine and edge cases, see [Zone Lifecycle](testing/behavior/zone-lifecycle.md).
