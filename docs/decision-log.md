## Decisions

### DEC-001: Protocol Naming

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Proposed

**Context:** Need a working name for the new protocol.

**Options Evaluated:**
1. MASH (Minimal Application-layer Smart Home)
2. LEAP (Lightweight Energy Application Protocol)
3. SIMPLE (Smart Interoperable Minimal Protocol for Local Energy)

**Decision:** MASH (working name, subject to change)

**Rationale:**
- Memorable and short
- Captures the "minimal" goal
- Works as both acronym and word

**Declined Alternatives:**
- LEAP: Too generic
- SIMPLE: Overused acronym pattern

---

### DEC-002: Design Philosophy - Simplicity over Flexibility

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** EEBUS chose maximum flexibility (7 RFE modes, 250+ data structures), leading to 7,000+ implementation variations.

**Options Evaluated:**
1. Keep EEBUS flexibility, improve documentation
2. Moderate flexibility with stricter guidelines
3. Minimal flexibility with fixed operations

**Decision:** Minimal flexibility with fixed operations

**Rationale:**
- EEBUS proves flexibility creates incompatibility
- Matter succeeds with simpler model (Read/Write/Subscribe/Invoke)
- Easier to add features later than remove complexity

**Declined Alternatives:**
- Option 1: Doesn't solve the fundamental problem
- Option 2: Half-measures lead to the same issues

---

### DEC-003: Target Hardware Constraints

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need to define minimum hardware requirements.

**Options Evaluated:**
1. High-end only (1MB+ RAM, 32-bit CPU)
2. Mid-range (256KB-512KB RAM, 32-bit CPU)
3. Ultra-low power (64KB RAM, basic MCU)
4. Linux/RTOS only

**Decision:** Mid-range (256KB RAM target, ESP32-class devices)

**Rationale:**
- Balances capability with real-world device constraints
- ESP32 is extremely common in energy devices
- Allows meaningful protocol without extreme compromises
- Still requires thoughtful message size design

**Declined Alternatives:**
- High-end only: Excludes too many embedded devices
- Ultra-low power: Would require extreme simplification, likely separate "lite" profile
- Linux only: Excludes the embedded devices we want to support

---

### DEC-004: Initial Use Case Scope

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need to define initial use cases to shape feature design.

**Options Evaluated:**
1. EV Charging only (most common EEBUS use case)
2. Load Control / Power Limits only
3. Measurement Data only
4. All three together

**Decision:** All three together

**Rationale:**
- These three use cases are interconnected in real deployments
- Designing for one would miss patterns needed by others
- EV charging inherently needs measurement and load control
- Better to have coherent design from start

---

### DEC-005: Commissioning Model

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** SHIP uses mDNS discovery + complex pairing with trust levels and PINs.

**Options Evaluated:**
1. Matter-style commissioning (QR code / setup code)
2. mDNS discovery + simplified pairing
3. Support both methods

**Decision:** Matter-style commissioning (QR code / setup code)

**Rationale:**
- Proven UX in consumer devices
- Simpler implementation than SHIP's trust level negotiation
- Avoids SHIP's PIN security flaws (no nonce, brute force vulnerable)
- Widely understood by installers and users
- Can still use mDNS for discovery after pairing

**Declined Alternatives:**
- mDNS + pairing: Still requires complex trust negotiation
- Both methods: Adds implementation complexity, unclear benefit

---

### DEC-006: Serialization Format

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need to choose message serialization format for 256KB RAM target.

**Options Evaluated:**
1. JSON (156 bytes for test message, human-readable)
2. CBOR (75-108 bytes, IETF standard RFC 8949)
3. MessagePack (105 bytes, no IETF standard)
4. Protocol Buffers (~85 bytes, requires code generation)
5. Custom TLV (~70 bytes, must build ourselves)

**Decision:** CBOR with integer keys for compactness

**Rationale:**
- 52% smaller than JSON without code generation
- IETF standard (RFC 8949) - not proprietary
- Used by Matter, CoAP, Thread - proven in IoT/embedded
- Self-describing - can decode without schema (debugging)
- Streaming parse possible - low RAM usage
- COSE (CBOR security) fits well for auth tokens

**Declined Alternatives:**
- JSON: Too large for constrained devices
- MessagePack: No IETF standard, less IoT adoption
- Protobuf: Code generation adds build complexity
- Custom TLV: High implementation risk, no tooling

**Mitigation for debuggability:**
- Build CLI tool with `cbor2json` conversion
- Use diagnostic notation in docs/logs

---

### DEC-007: Device Model Hierarchy

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need to define how devices, capabilities, and data are structured.

**Options Evaluated:**
1. 2-Level: Device > Feature (simpler, but needs array indices for multi-port)
2. 3-Level: Device > Endpoint > Feature (like Matter's Device > Endpoint > Cluster)
3. Variable depth (flexible but complex parsing)

**Decision:** 3-Level hierarchy: Device > Endpoint > Feature

**Rationale:**
- Cleanly handles multi-function devices (dual-port EVSEs, hybrid inverters)
- Matter-aligned - familiar to developers
- Fixed depth = simple, predictable parsing
- Minimal overhead for single-function devices (use endpoint 1)
- Future-proof for complex device types

**Addressing Scheme:**
```
device_id / endpoint_id / feature_id / attribute_or_command
```

**Endpoint Conventions:**
- Endpoint 0: Root device info (manufacturer, model, etc.)
- Endpoint 1+: Functional endpoints (charger port, inverter section, etc.)

**Declined Alternatives:**
- 2-Level: Requires array indices (`Measurement[0]`) - less semantic clarity
- Variable depth: Complicates parsing, unclear benefit

### DEC-008: Interaction Model

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** SPINE has 7 RFE operation modes creating 7,000+ implementation variations.

**Options Evaluated:**
1. 7 Operations (like SPINE: replaceAll, updateAll, partial, delete, deleteAll, notify, read)
2. 5 Operations (Read, Write, Subscribe, Invoke + Partial Write)
3. 4 Operations (like Matter: Read, Write, Subscribe, Invoke)
4. 3 Operations (Read, Write, Invoke - no subscriptions)

**Decision:** 4 Operations (Read, Write, Subscribe, Invoke)

**Rationale:**
- Write replaces the entire value - no partial update complexity
- Subscribe handles notifications (no separate "notify" mode)
- Invoke for commands with parameters
- Read for current state
- Dramatically reduces implementation complexity

**Declined Alternatives:**
- Partial updates: Adds significant complexity for marginal benefit
- 3 operations (no subscribe): Forces polling, inefficient

---

### DEC-009: Connection Initiation

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** SHIP allows both peers to initiate connections, causing race conditions.

**Options Evaluated:**
1. Client initiates only (controller → device)
2. Either can initiate (like SHIP)
3. Server initiates (push model)

**Decision:** Client initiates only

**Rationale:**
- Deterministic - no race conditions
- Natural model: energy manager (client) connects to EVSE (server)
- Simpler implementation
- Eliminates SHIP's "double connection" problem entirely

---

### DEC-010: Multi-Controller and Pairing Model

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** When multiple controllers exist, need clear rules for who controls what.

**Options Evaluated:**
1. First wins, others rejected
2. Priority-based takeover
3. Shared control allowed
4. Capability-based routing with user confirmation

**Decision:** Hybrid capability-routing with priority override

**Key Principles:**
1. **Discovery**: Controllers discover devices and their capabilities
2. **Suggestion**: System suggests pairings based on capability matching
3. **User Confirmation**: User confirms pairing (required)
4. **Priority Takeover**: Higher-priority controller can request takeover
5. **User Override**: User can always override priority (e.g., disconnect grid operator)

**Priority Levels (example):**
- Level 1: Grid Operator / DSO (highest)
- Level 2: Building/Commercial Energy Manager
- Level 3: Home Energy Manager
- Level 4: User App (lowest)

**Takeover Flow:**
1. New controller requests control with its priority level
2. Device notifies current controller of takeover request
3. If higher priority: takeover succeeds (current controller notified)
4. User can physically interact with device to reject takeover

**Rationale:**
- Avoids SPINE's undefined "appropriate client"
- Enables grid override scenarios
- User always has final say
- Clear, deterministic behavior

## Pending Decisions

### DEC-011: Transport Layer

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need to choose transport for 256KB devices. SHIP uses WebSocket/TLS, Matter uses UDP+MRP or TCP.

**Options Evaluated:**
1. WebSocket over TLS (like SHIP) - ~55KB code
2. Raw TCP/TLS with length-prefix framing - ~42KB code
3. CoAP over DTLS - ~60KB code, UDP NAT issues
4. UDP with custom reliability (like Matter MRP)
5. QUIC - ~200KB+, too heavy

**Decision:** TCP/TLS with simple length-prefix framing

**Rationale:**
- **TCP reliability built-in** - no need to implement MRP ourselves
- **Smallest code footprint** - ~42KB vs 55KB for WebSocket
- **Minimal overhead** - 4 bytes per message vs 2-14 for WebSocket
- **Sufficient for target devices** - EVSEs, inverters are always-on, not battery
- **Simple implementation** - TLS library + trivial framing code

**Framing Format:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Length (4B, big-endian) │ CBOR Payload │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Keep-Alive Protocol (to be defined):**
- Ping/pong messages in CBOR
- 30-second interval
- Connection closed after 3 missed pongs

**Declined Alternatives:**
- WebSocket: Extra 13KB code, HTTP upgrade overhead not needed
- CoAP/DTLS: UDP NAT issues in home networks
- UDP+MRP: Unnecessary complexity for always-on devices
- QUIC: Won't fit in 256KB RAM

---

### DEC-012: Device Attestation Model

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need to decide if devices must prove authenticity via manufacturer certificates.

**Options Evaluated:**
1. Required attestation (all devices need manufacturer CA)
2. Optional attestation (support CA if present, allow self-signed)
3. No attestation (self-signed only)

**Decision:** Optional attestation

**Rationale:**
- Supports large manufacturers with CA infrastructure
- Doesn't exclude small vendors or DIY devices
- Trust ultimately established through pairing, not certificate chain
- Pragmatic for energy device ecosystem

---

### DEC-013: Operational Certificates

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** After pairing, should devices get controller-issued certificates?

**Options Evaluated:**
1. Operational certs (controller issues during pairing)
2. Device cert only (keep using original)

**Decision:** Operational certificates

**Rationale:**
- Enables certificate rotation (1-year validity)
- Supports multi-controller (each controller issues own zone cert)
- Clean revocation via cert deletion
- Like Matter's NOC model

**Lifecycle:**
- Validity: 1 year
- Renewal: Auto-renewed by controller before expiry
- Revocation: Controller sends delete command to device

---

### DEC-014: Pairing Protocol

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** How to establish initial trust between controller and device.

**Options Evaluated:**
1. SPAKE2+ with numeric code (like Matter PASE)
2. Simple pre-shared key
3. Certificate fingerprint in QR

**Decision:** SPAKE2+ with 8-digit numeric setup code

**Rationale:**
- Proven PAKE protocol (used by Matter)
- No secrets transmitted in clear
- Resistant to offline dictionary attacks
- 8 digits provides ~27 bits entropy (sufficient for local pairing)
- Easy to type manually if needed

**Setup Code Format:**
- 8 decimal digits (00000000-99999999)
- Encoded in QR code with discriminator + vendor info
- Optional: printed on device label

---

### DEC-015: Certificate Lifecycle

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** How long are certificates valid and how are they managed.

**Decision:**

| Certificate | Validity | Renewal | Revocation |
|-------------|----------|---------|------------|
| Device/Attestation | 20 years | Never | N/A |
| Operational | 1 year | Auto by controller | Controller deletes from device |
| Zone CA | 99 years | N/A | Zone removal |

**Note:** Zone CA uses very long validity (99 years) because:
- Zone ID is derived from CA certificate fingerprint
- Changing CA would require re-commissioning all devices
- Expiry doesn't add security (zone removal is the revocation mechanism)
- Effectively "permanent" for practical purposes

**Revocation Flow:**
1. Controller decides to remove device
2. Controller sends "RemoveZone" command
3. Device deletes operational certificate
4. Device returns to unpaired state

---

### DEC-016: Multi-Zone Support

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Real deployments have multiple controllers (SMGW, EMS, apps) needing access.

**Options Evaluated:**
1. Single zone with roles (one CA, shared)
2. Multiple zones (each controller independent)

**Decision:** Multiple zones

**Rationale:**
- Each controller (SMGW, EMS) is independent with own Zone CA
- Device holds multiple operational certs (one per zone)
- No coupling between controllers
- SMGW replacement doesn't affect EMS
- Like Matter's multi-admin model

**Implementation:**
- Device supports up to 5 zones
- Each zone has: type, CA, operational cert
- ZoneManagement feature for add/remove
- Zones can see each other's types for coordination

---

### DEC-017: Per-Feature Priority

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** When multiple controllers want to control the same feature, who wins?

**Options Evaluated:**
1. Zone type priority (GRID > BUILDING > HOME > USER)
2. Most restrictive wins (min of all limits)
3. Separate limits tracked per controller

**Decision:** Zone type priority

**Zone Types (priority order):**
```
GRID = 1   // DSO, SMGW, utility - external/regulatory authority
LOCAL = 2  // Residential/building EMS - local energy management
```

**Behavior:**
- Higher priority can clear/remove lower priority's settings
- Lower priority is notified of changes
- User physical override always possible (button on device)

**Important Clarification (see DEC-024):**
- For **limits** specifically, priority does NOT override
- All zone limits are tracked, most restrictive (min) wins
- This ensures safety constraints (fuses, wiring) are respected
- Priority matters for: access control, removing others' settings, notifications

---

### DEC-018: Setup Code Reusability

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Can the same setup code be used for multiple zone commissionings?

**Decision:** Static setup code, reusable for all zones

**Rationale (like Matter):**
- Setup code is factory-programmed, printed on device
- Same code used for all zone commissionings
- Security provided by:
  1. Physical access to QR code required
  2. SPAKE2+ protocol prevents eavesdropping
  3. User scanning implies consent
- No benefit to rolling codes - physical access is the gate

---

### DEC-019: Delegated Commissioning (Backend)

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** SMGW has no UI - can't scan QR codes directly.

**Decision:** Support delegated commissioning via backend

**Flow:**
1. User scans device QR with utility app (phone)
2. App uploads setup code + device info to DSO backend
3. Backend securely forwards to SMGW
4. SMGW uses setup code to commission device via SPAKE2+
5. Device gets SMGW's operational cert (GRID zone)

**QR Code Content (sufficient for backend delegation):**
```
MASH:<version>:<discriminator>:<setupcode>:<vendorid>:<productid>
```

**Security:**
- Backend must securely store/transmit setup codes
- TLS between all components
- Setup code only valuable with network access to device

### DEC-020: Zone Roles (Owner vs Admin)

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** How do apps participate in commissioning without being fragile zone owners?

**Decision:** Three-tier role model

| Role | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Zone Owner** | Owns Zone CA, issues certs | EMS, SMGW |
| **Zone Admin** | Authorized to commission | Phone App, Installer Tool |
| **Zone Member** | Normal participant | Devices |

**Key Principles:**
- Apps are admins, NOT owners (losing phone doesn't orphan devices)
- EMS is always zone owner (has CA)
- Apps cannot own zones - always need an EMS
- Multiple admins supported (family members, installers)

**Commissioning with Admin:**
1. App has admin token from EMS
2. App does SPAKE2+ with device (has setup code)
3. App gets CSR from device
4. App **forwards CSR to EMS** (app can't sign)
5. EMS signs, returns operational cert
6. App installs cert on device

---

### DEC-021: App-EMS Admin Authorization

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** How does an app become a zone admin for an EMS?

**Decision:** QR code + confirmation via EMS web UI

**Flow:**
```
User             Phone App           EMS Web UI
 │                   │                   │
 │── Open web UI ────┼──────────────────►│
 │── "Add admin" ────┼──────────────────►│
 │◄──────────────────┼── Show temp QR ───┤  (5 min expiry)
 │                   │                   │
 │── Scan QR ───────►│                   │
 │                   │── SPAKE2+ ───────►│
 │                   │                   │
 │◄──────────────────┼── "Add 'Phone'?" ─┤
 │── Confirm ────────┼──────────────────►│
 │                   │◄── Admin token ───┤
```

**Security:**
- QR is temporary (5 min expiry)
- User must confirm in EMS UI (proves access to EMS)
- App name displayed for verification

**Pre-requisite:**
- EMS must have web UI (local or cloud-based)
- User must have access to EMS UI to add admins

---

### DEC-022: IPv6-Only Network Layer

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need to decide on IP version for the network layer.

**Options Evaluated:**
1. IPv4 only (legacy)
2. Dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 (two code paths)
3. IPv6 mandatory with IPv4 fallback
4. IPv6 only (no IPv4)

**Decision:** IPv6 only - no IPv4 support

**Rationale:**
- **Simpler implementation** - one code path, not two
- **Link-local (fe80::) always works** - even without DHCP/router
- **Linux support since 1999** - kernel 2.2, over 25 years ago
- **All modern embedded platforms support it** - ESP32, etc.
- **Matter is IPv6-only** - proven approach
- **Thread ready** - IPv6-only mesh, door open for future Thread support
- **No NAT issues** - every device gets unique address
- **Multicast discovery** - native support (ff02::fb for mDNS)

**IPv6 Features Used:**
```
Link-Local (fe80::/10)
├── Always available without configuration
├── Used for commissioning
└── Works without router/DHCP

Multicast (ff02::)
├── ff02::fb - mDNS discovery
└── Efficient group communication

SLAAC
└── Auto-configuration without DHCP
```

**Declined Alternatives:**
- IPv4 only: Legacy, NAT issues, limited addresses
- Dual-stack: Doubles implementation complexity, testing burden
- IPv4 fallback: No realistic scenario where needed
  - Old routers: Even cheap routers from 5+ years ago support IPv6
  - Old networks: We target new devices, not retrofitting
  - Corporate networks: Smart home devices aren't on corporate networks

---

### DEC-024: Limit Resolution - Stacked Limits (Most Restrictive Wins)

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** When multiple zones set limits on the same feature, how are they resolved?

**Options Evaluated:**
1. Priority override (higher priority zone's limit wins, others ignored)
2. Most restrictive wins (min of all limits, all tracked)
3. Subscription-based (notify on removal, let zones re-apply)

**Decision:** Most restrictive wins (stacked limits)

**Critical Example - Why Priority Override Fails:**
```
SMGW (GRID, priority 1): "Grid allows 6 kW"
EMS (LOCAL, priority 2):   "House fuse is 5 kW"

Priority-based: 6 kW → exceeds fuse capacity → dangerous
Stacked limits: min(6, 5) = 5 kW → safe
```

**Lower priority controllers MUST be able to impose stricter limits** for physical safety constraints (fuses, wiring, device ratings).

**Internal vs Exposed State:**
```
Device internal state (not exposed):
  zoneLimits: map[zoneID] → limit
    Zone 1 (GRID): 6000 W
    Zone 2 (LOCAL):  5000 W

Exposed via API (per-zone scoped):
  effectiveLimit: min(all) = 5000 W    // same for all zones
  myLimit: 6000 W or 5000 W            // depends on requesting zone
  limitActive: true/false              // is my limit the effective one?
```

**API Design (simple, zone-isolated):**
```
Limit feature:
  Attributes:
    - effectiveLimit: uint32 (W)   // min(all zone limits)
    - myLimit: uint32 (W)          // this zone's limit (zone-scoped)
    - limitActive: bool            // is my limit the effective one?

  Commands:
    - SetLimit(value, duration?)
    - ClearLimit()
```

**Why NOT expose per-zone limits:**
- Each zone knows its own limit (it set it)
- Each zone can see effective limit
- Zone isolation / privacy between controllers
- Simpler API, less data in messages
- Device handles complexity internally

**What Priority IS Used For:**
| Aspect | Priority-based? |
|--------|-----------------|
| Setting limits | No - all zones can set |
| Effective limit | No - min(all) wins |
| Removing OTHER zone's limits | Yes - higher can clear lower |
| Access to other features | Yes - per DEC-017 |

**Subscription for Awareness:**
- Zones subscribe to Limit.effectiveLimit
- Get notified when effective limit changes
- Can infer: if effectiveLimit < myLimit, someone else is more restrictive
- EMS knows when constraint lifts (can adjust strategy)

**Declined Alternatives:**
- Priority override: Dangerous - ignores physical constraints
- Subscription re-apply: Extra complexity, race conditions, still doesn't solve fuse scenario

---

### DEC-025: Terminology - "Feature" instead of "Cluster"

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Matter uses "cluster" for groupings of attributes and commands. Should we use the same term?

**Options Evaluated:**
1. Cluster (Matter terminology)
2. Feature (functional building block)
3. Capability
4. Service
5. Component

**Decision:** Use "Feature" as our terminology

**Rationale:**
- **Intuitive** - "device supports Limit feature" reads naturally
- **Functional focus** - describes what it does, not structure
- **Reusable** - features are building blocks composed into endpoints
- **Distinct from Matter** - avoids implying compatibility

**Terminology Mapping:**
| Matter | MASH |
|--------|------|
| Cluster | Feature |
| Cluster ID | Feature ID |

**Updated Hierarchy:**
```
Device > Endpoint > Feature > Attributes/Commands
```

**Core Features:**
| Feature | Purpose | Used By |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `Limit` | Power constraints, set/clear | EVSE, Inverter, Heat Pump |
| `Measurement` | Power, energy, voltage, current | All devices |
| `ChargingSession` | EV session state, SoC | EVSE only |
| `DeviceInfo` | Identity, firmware, capabilities | All (endpoint 0) |

**Device Composition Example:**
```
EVSE
├── Endpoint 0: DeviceInfo
└── Endpoint 1: Measurement + Limit + ChargingSession

Inverter
├── Endpoint 0: DeviceInfo
└── Endpoint 1: Measurement + Limit
```

**Declined Alternatives:**
- Cluster: Matter terminology, implies compatibility
- Capability: Too vague
- Service: Overloaded (web services, systemd, etc.)
- Component: Implies UI/frontend

---

### DEC-023: Terminology - "Zone" instead of "Fabric"

**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Matter uses "fabric" for trust boundaries / controller domains. Should we adopt the same term or choose our own?

**Options Evaluated:**
1. Fabric (Matter terminology)
2. Authority
3. Realm
4. Trust
5. Domain
6. Zone
7. Scope
8. Sector

**Decision:** Use "Zone" as our terminology

**Rationale:**
- **Simple and clear** - no explanation needed
- **No baggage** - unlike "domain" (DNS/AD) or "realm" (Kerberos)
- **Industrial/energy feel** - fits the smart energy context
- **Distinct from Matter** - avoids implying compatibility
- **Works naturally in context:**
  - "Device supports up to 5 zones"
  - "Add device to EMS zone"
  - "Zone owner vs zone admin"
  - "GRID zone has priority"

**Terminology Mapping:**
| Matter | MASH |
|--------|------|
| Fabric | Zone |
| Fabric ID | Zone ID |
| Fabric CA | Zone CA |
| Multi-fabric | Multi-zone |
| AddFabric | AddZone |
| RemoveFabric | RemoveZone |

**Declined Alternatives:**
- Fabric: Implies Matter compatibility, borrowed terminology
- Authority: Slightly redundant with "zone owner"
- Realm: Fantasy/Kerberos connotations
- Domain: DNS/Active Directory confusion
- Trust: Grammatically awkward in some contexts

### DEC-026: EnergyControl Feature Design (Capability-First, Forecast-Optional)

**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need to define the Limit/EnergyControl feature that covers all EEBUS limit use cases (LPC, LPP, OPEV, OSCEV, CEVC, DBEVC, COB, OHPCF, POEN) while being simpler. Matter's DeviceEnergyManagement cluster is forecast-centric, but not all devices can provide forecasts (e.g., basic wallbox doesn't know EV's plan).

**Options Evaluated:**
1. EEBUS approach: Separate use cases for each device type (10+ specs)
2. Matter approach: Forecast-centric with PowerForecast/StateForecast required
3. Capability-first: Device announces what it CAN do, forecast optional

**Decision:** Capability-first, forecast-optional design

**Key Principle:**
```
Every device announces: "What I CAN do" (capabilities)  ← MANDATORY
Some devices announce:  "What I PLAN to do" (forecast)  ← OPTIONAL
Controller sends:       "What I WANT you to do" (limit) ← CORE FUNCTION
```

**Rationale:**
- **All devices can announce capabilities** - even the simplest EVSE knows its max power
- **Not all devices can forecast** - wallbox without ISO 15118-20 doesn't know EV plans
- **Forecasts add value when available** - smart devices can optimize better
- **Single feature covers all EEBUS use cases** - no separate LPC/LPP/OPEV/etc.
- **Matter-inspired simplicity** - feature flags, not separate protocols

**Feature Structure:**

```
EnergyControl Feature
├── MANDATORY (all controllable devices):
│   ├── deviceType: DeviceTypeEnum
│   ├── state: StateEnum
│   ├── capabilities: CapabilityStruct
│   ├── effectiveLimit: int64 (mW)
│   └── optOutState: OptOutEnum

```

```
NO_OPT_OUT        = 0   // Accept all adjustments
LOCAL_OPT_OUT     = 1   // Reject local optimization
GRID_OPT_OUT      = 2   // Reject grid requests
OPT_OUT           = 3   // Reject all external control
```

```
SetLimit(
  power: int64 (mW),        // + consumption limit, - production limit
  duration: uint32? (s),    // Optional (0 = indefinite)
  cause: LimitCauseEnum
) → { success: bool, effectiveLimit: int64 }

ClearLimit() → { success: bool }

Pause(duration: uint32? (s)) → { success: bool }
Resume() → { success: bool }

AdjustStartTime(
  requestedStart: timestamp,
  cause: LimitCauseEnum
) → { success: bool, actualStart: timestamp }
```

**EEBUS Use Case Mapping:**

| EEBUS Use Case | MASH Coverage |
|----------------|---------------|
| LPC (Limit Power Consumption) | SetLimit with CONSUMPTION direction |
| LPP (Limit Power Production) | SetLimit with PRODUCTION direction |
| OPEV (Overload Protection EV) | SetLimit with LOCAL_PROTECTION cause |
| OSCEV (Self-Consumption EV) | Flexibility + SetLimit with LOCAL_OPTIMIZATION |
| CEVC (Coordinated EV Charging) | Forecast + Flexibility |
| DBEVC (Bidirectional EV) | BIDIRECTIONAL direction + Forecast |
| COB (Control of Battery) | BIDIRECTIONAL direction + SetLimit |
| OHPCF (Heat Pump Flexibility) | isPausable + isShiftable + Pause/Resume |
| POEN (Power Envelope) | Repeated SetLimit calls (or future schedule extension) |

**Failsafe Behavior (inherited from transport):**
1. Keep-alive fails (3 missed pongs)
2. Device state → FAILSAFE
3. Device applies failsafe limit (from capabilities)
4. On reconnect: zone must re-set limit
5. Device exits FAILSAFE when valid limit received

**Declined Alternatives:**
- EEBUS approach: 10+ use cases too complex, testing nightmare
- Pure forecast approach: Not all devices can forecast (basic wallbox)
- Current-based limits (OPEV style): Always use power (W), device converts

**Resolves:** OPEN-001 (Feature Definitions) - partially

### DEC-027: Feature Separation (Electrical, Measurement, EnergyControl)

**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** During EnergyControl feature design, we realized phase configuration and electrical ratings are needed both for control (EnergyControl) and for interpreting measurement data. Similarly, measurement data (power readings, SoC) is distinct from control capabilities.

**Options Evaluated:**
1. Single monolithic feature with all electrical data
2. Two features: Electrical + EnergyControl (measurements in both)
3. Three features: Electrical (config), Measurement (telemetry), EnergyControl (control)

**Decision:** Three separate features with clear responsibilities

**Feature Responsibilities:**

| Feature | Question | Examples | Update Frequency |
|---------|----------|----------|------------------|
| **Electrical** | "What is this device?" | Phase config, voltage ratings, nominal power | Read once at discovery |
| **Measurement** | "What is it doing now?" | Power readings, energy totals, SoC | Subscribe for real-time |
| **EnergyControl** | "What can I tell it to do?" | Capabilities, limits, commands | Subscribe for state changes |

**Electrical Feature (Static Configuration):**
```
- phaseCount: 1, 2, or 3
- phaseMapping: {DevicePhase → GridPhase} for coordination
- nominalVoltage, supportedDirections
- nominalMaxConsumption, nominalMaxProduction (power ratings)
- maxCurrentPerPhase (for OPEV-style limits)
- supportsAsymmetric, phaseCurrentDirections
- energyCapacity (for batteries)
```

**Measurement Feature (Telemetry):**
```
- activePower, reactivePower (total, signed)
- energyConsumed, energyProduced (cumulative)
- stateOfCharge (for batteries)
- perPhaseReadings: {phase → {power, current, voltage}}
```

**EnergyControl Feature (Control):**
```
- deviceType, deviceState (capability flags)
- isPausable, isShiftable, canForecast
- consumptionLimit, productionLimit (active limits)
- currentLimits (per-phase, for OPEV)
- forecast (optional)
- Commands: SetLimit, SetCurrentLimits, ClearLimit, Pause, Resume
```

**Rationale:**
- **Separation of concerns**: Static config vs telemetry vs control have different update patterns
- **Efficiency**: Subscribe only to what you need (measurements or control state)
- **Reusability**: Measurement feature useful without EnergyControl (e.g., pure monitoring)
- **Phase consistency**: Phase mapping defined once in Electrical, used by both Measurement and EnergyControl
- **Per-phase current limits**: Supports OPEV-style asymmetric current limits + bidirectional (EEBUS gap)

**Phase Mapping Design:**
```
Device declares in Electrical:
  phaseMapping: {A: L1, B: L2, C: L3}  // or rotated: {A: L2, B: L3, C: L1}

Controller can now:
  - Interpret per-phase measurements correctly
  - Set per-phase current limits on correct grid phases
```

**Declined Alternatives:**
- Single feature: Too large, inefficient subscriptions, mixed update frequencies
- Two features: Unclear where measurements belong, phase config duplicated

**Resolves:** OPEN-001 (Feature Definitions) - Electrical and Measurement features now defined

---

### DEC-028: Setpoints and V2H Phase Balancing

**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Limits ("do not exceed") are not sufficient for all control scenarios. Battery systems, solar charging, and V2H bidirectional EVs need setpoints ("please target this value"). Additionally, V2H with asymmetric phase support requires per-phase current setpoints to balance household load across phases.

**Options Evaluated:**
1. Limits only - devices figure out their own targets
2. Single setpoint command (total power only)
3. Separate setpoint commands for power and per-phase current (mirrors limit structure)

**Decision:** Symmetric command structure for limits and setpoints

**New Commands:**
| | Total Power (mW) | Per-Phase Current (mA) |
|--|------------------|------------------------|
| **Hard constraint** | SetLimit | SetCurrentLimits |
| **Target** | SetSetpoint | SetCurrentSetpoints |
| **Clear constraint** | ClearLimit | ClearCurrentLimits |
| **Clear target** | ClearSetpoint | ClearCurrentSetpoints |

**New Capabilities:**
```
acceptsLimits: bool           // accepts SetLimit
acceptsCurrentLimits: bool    // accepts SetCurrentLimits
acceptsSetpoints: bool        // accepts SetSetpoint
acceptsCurrentSetpoints: bool // accepts SetCurrentSetpoints (V2H)
```

**AsymmetricSupportEnum (replaces bool):**
```
NONE          = 0x00  // Symmetric only
CONSUMPTION   = 0x01  // Asymmetric when charging
PRODUCTION    = 0x02  // Asymmetric when discharging
BIDIRECTIONAL = 0x03  // Asymmetric both directions
```

**Resolution Difference:**
```
LIMITS:    Most restrictive wins (all zones constrain together)
SETPOINTS: Highest priority zone wins (only one controller active)
```

**V2H Use Case:**
```
House consumption: L1=20A, L2=5A, L3=12A
EMS sends: SetCurrentSetpoints({A: 10000, B: 2000, C: 5000}, PRODUCTION, PHASE_BALANCING)
V2H EV discharges asymmetrically to balance phases
Result: Net import L1=10A, L2=3A, L3=7A (balanced)
```

**Rationale:**
- Symmetric structure is easier to learn and implement
- Per-phase current setpoints enable V2H phase balancing (EEBUS gap)
- AsymmetricSupportEnum clarifies which directions support different values per phase
- Limits constrain setpoints (device can't target beyond its limit)

**Extends EEBUS:**
- DBEVC only supports total power setpoints, not per-phase
- No EEBUS use case covers asymmetric discharge for phase balancing
- MASH fills this gap with SetCurrentSetpoints

### DEC-029: Measurement Feature and EndpointType

**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need comprehensive measurement support covering all EEBUS monitoring use cases (MPC, MGCP, EVCEM, MOI, MOB, MPS). Also need a way to identify what each endpoint represents in multi-component devices like hybrid inverters.

**Options Evaluated for Measurements:**
1. Single feature with AC-only measurements
2. Separate AcMeasurement and DcMeasurement features
3. Single Measurement feature with both AC and DC attributes

**Decision:** Single Measurement feature with comprehensive AC and DC support

**Measurement Attributes:**

| Category | Attributes | Used By |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **AC Power** | acActivePower, acReactivePower, acApparentPower, acActivePowerPerPhase | INVERTER, GRID_CONNECTION, EV_CHARGER |
| **AC Current/Voltage** | acCurrentPerPhase, acVoltagePerPhase, acVoltagePhaseToPhasePair, acFrequency, powerFactor | All AC endpoints |
| **AC Energy** | acEnergyConsumed, acEnergyProduced | All AC endpoints |
| **DC Measurements** | dcPower, dcCurrent, dcVoltage, dcEnergyIn, dcEnergyOut | PV_STRING, BATTERY |
| **Battery State** | stateOfCharge, stateOfHealth, stateOfEnergy, useableCapacity, cycleCount | BATTERY |
| **Temperature** | temperature | BATTERY, INVERTER |

**EndpointType Enum:**

```
DEVICE_ROOT       = 0x00  // Device-level info (always endpoint 0)
GRID_CONNECTION   = 0x01  // AC grid connection point (smart meter)
INVERTER          = 0x02  // Inverter AC side (grid-facing)
PV_STRING         = 0x03  // PV string / solar input (DC)
BATTERY           = 0x04  // Battery storage (DC)
EV_CHARGER        = 0x05  // EVSE / wallbox
HEAT_PUMP         = 0x06  // Heat pump
WATER_HEATER      = 0x07  // Water heater / boiler
HVAC              = 0x08  // HVAC system
APPLIANCE         = 0x09  // Generic controllable appliance
SUB_METER         = 0x0A  // Sub-meter / circuit monitor
```

**Hybrid Inverter Example:**

```
Device (hybrid-inverter)
├── Endpoint 0: type=DEVICE_ROOT
├── Endpoint 1: type=INVERTER, label="Grid Connection"
│   └── Measurement: AC power, energy, voltage, current
├── Endpoint 2: type=PV_STRING, label="Roof South"
│   └── Measurement: DC power, voltage, current, yield
├── Endpoint 3: type=PV_STRING, label="Roof West"
│   └── Measurement: DC power, voltage, current, yield
└── Endpoint 4: type=BATTERY, label="LG Chem"
    └── Measurement: DC power, SoC, SoH, temperature
```

**Topology is Implicit:**
- AC endpoints (INVERTER, GRID_CONNECTION) → connect to grid
- DC endpoints (PV_STRING, BATTERY) → internal, connect to inverter DC bus
- No explicit parent/child relationships needed (grid is never DC)

**Sign Convention (Passive/Load):**
- Positive (+) = power flowing INTO component (consumption, charging)
- Negative (-) = power flowing OUT of component (production, discharging)

**EEBUS Use Case Coverage:**

| EEBUS | MASH Coverage |
|-------|---------------|
| MPC | acActivePower, acCurrentPerPhase, acVoltagePerPhase, acFrequency, acEnergy |
| MGCP | Same as MPC on GRID_CONNECTION endpoint |
| EVCEM | acActivePower, acCurrentPerPhase, acEnergyConsumed |
| MOI | All AC power types, powerFactor, temperature |
| MOB | dcPower/Current/Voltage, stateOfCharge/Health, cycleCount, temperature |
| MPS | dcPower, dcCurrent, dcVoltage, dcEnergyOut |

**Rationale:**
- Single feature simplifies subscription (one subscription for all measurements)
- EndpointType identifies component role without complex relationships
- AC/DC distinction covers all real-world scenarios
- Comprehensive coverage of 6+ EEBUS monitoring use cases

**Resolves:** OPEN-001 (Feature Definitions) - Measurement feature now fully defined

### DEC-030: Status Feature for Operating State

**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Operating state (running, standby, fault, etc.) was initially considered part of EnergyControl. However, non-controllable devices (e.g., monitoring-only devices, smart meters) also have operating states but don't support EnergyControl.

**Options Evaluated:**
1. Keep operating state in EnergyControl (requires EnergyControl for all devices)
2. Create separate Status feature (applicable to any endpoint)
3. Put operating state in DeviceInfo (but state is per-endpoint, not per-device)

**Decision:** Separate Status feature, per-endpoint

**Status Feature Attributes:**
```
{
  1: operatingState,    // OperatingStateEnum
  2: stateDetail,       // uint32 (vendor-specific sub-state)
  3: faultCode,         // uint32 (0 = no fault)
  4: faultMessage,      // string (optional human-readable)
}
```

**OperatingStateEnum:**
```
UNKNOWN       = 0x00  // State cannot be determined
OFFLINE       = 0x01  // Not connected / powered off
STANDBY       = 0x02  // Ready but not active
STARTING      = 0x03  // Transitioning to running
RUNNING       = 0x04  // Normal operation
PAUSED        = 0x05  // Temporarily suspended
SHUTTING_DOWN = 0x06  // Transitioning to offline
FAULT         = 0x07  // Error state (check faultCode)
MAINTENANCE   = 0x08  // Service/maintenance mode
```

**Per-Endpoint Scope:**
- Each endpoint has its own Status feature instance
- Hybrid inverter: PV_STRING endpoints can be RUNNING while BATTERY is STANDBY
- EVSE: Port 1 can be RUNNING (charging) while Port 2 is STANDBY

**Relationship to Other Features:**
```
Status Feature: "What's happening?" (state observation)
  └── operatingState: RUNNING, STANDBY, FAULT, etc.

EnergyControl Feature: "What can I tell it to do?" (control)
  └── Pause/Resume commands → affect operatingState
```

**Rationale:**
- Operating state is universally applicable (monitoring-only devices need it)
- Per-endpoint allows fine-grained status for multi-component devices
- Separates observation from control (EnergyControl is optional)
- Fault reporting tied to specific endpoint (not device-global)

**Declined Alternatives:**
- State in EnergyControl: Forces controllable interface on monitoring devices
- State in DeviceInfo: DeviceInfo is device-level (endpoint 0), state is per-endpoint

**Resolves:** OPEN-001 (Feature Definitions) - Status feature now defined

---

### DEC-031: DeviceInfo Feature with Complete Device Structure

**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need a feature for device identification and discovery. EEBUS uses DeviceClassification (NID use case) with multiple function types. Matter uses Basic Information cluster on endpoint 0. Key question: how to minimize round-trips while providing complete device understanding.

**Options Evaluated:**
1. Minimal DeviceInfo (identity only) + separate Descriptor feature per endpoint
2. DeviceInfo with device identity + complete endpoint/feature structure
3. DeviceInfo + UseCaseInformation (like EEBUS) for capability discovery

**Decision:** DeviceInfo with complete device structure in single read

**Device ID Format:**
```
i:<IANA_PEN>:<unique>   - For vendors with IANA Private Enterprise Number
n:<vendor>:<unique>     - For vendors without IANA PEN
```

Examples:
- `i:46925:ABC123-XYZ` (using IANA PEN 46925)
- `n:acme:WB-2024-001` (using vendor name "acme")

**DeviceInfo Attributes:**
```
Identification: deviceId, vendorName, productName, productId, serialNumber, brandName?
Versions:       softwareVersion, hardwareVersion
Structure:      endpoints[] (id, type, label?, features[])
```

**Key Design Choices:**

| Choice | Decision | Rationale |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Single read | Yes | One request gets everything needed to understand device |
| Endpoint structure | Included | No separate discovery needed |
| Feature list | Per-endpoint | Know exactly what each endpoint supports |
| User labels | Not included | EMS manages labels, simplifies device |
| Protocol version | Not included | Handled at connection level |
| Numeric vendor ID | Not required | String-based deviceId format sufficient |

**Feature ID Registry:**
```
0x0001  DeviceInfo
0x0002  Status
0x0003  Electrical
0x0004  Measurement
0x0005  EnergyControl
0x0006  ChargingSession
0x0007  Tariff
0x0008  Signals
0x0009  Plan
0x0100+ Vendor-specific
```

**EEBUS NID Coverage:**
- All mandatory NID data points covered (Device Name, Serial Number, Brand Name)
- Optional fields mapped (Device Code, Software/Hardware Revision, Vendor Name/Code)
- User-configurable fields (Label, Description) not on device - EMS responsibility

**Rationale:**
- Single read minimizes round-trips (vs EEBUS's multiple requests)
- Complete structure enables immediate understanding of device capabilities
- IANA PEN format provides globally unique IDs without central registry for all
- Manufacturer labels on endpoints helpful for multi-component devices
- Read-only simplifies device implementation

**Declined Alternatives:**
- Separate Descriptor feature: Extra round-trips, unnecessary complexity
- UseCaseInformation: Too EEBUS-specific, features list is sufficient
- Numeric vendor/product IDs: Would require central registry

**Resolves:** OPEN-001 (Feature Definitions) - DeviceInfo feature now defined

---

### DEC-032: ChargingSession Feature for EV Charging

**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need a feature for EV charging session data that accommodates different protocol capabilities (IEC 61851, ISO 15118-2, ISO 15118-20) and supports V2G bidirectional charging. Must cover EEBUS use cases: EVSOC, EVCS, SMR, EVCC/EVSECC, CEVC, DBEVC.

**Key Design Decisions:**

**1. Protocol-Aware Design:**
```
IEC 61851-1:  No smart comm - only session state/energy
ISO 15118-2:  SoC, energy demands, scheduled mode
ISO 15118-20: Dynamic control, V2G discharge constraints
```
All fields nullable to accommodate capability differences.

**2. Multiple EV Identifications:**
```cbor
evIdentifications: [
  { type: RFID, value: "04E57CD2..." },
  { type: MAC_EUI48, value: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF" },
  { type: VIN, value: "WVWZZZ3CZWE123456" },
  { type: PCID, value: "PCID-VW-2024-ABC" }
]
```
EVs can be identified via multiple mechanisms simultaneously.

**3. Energy Requests as Deltas (ISO 15118-20 style):**
```
evMinEnergyRequest = (minSoC - currentSoC) * capacity
evTargetEnergyRequest = (targetSoC - currentSoC) * capacity
evMaxEnergyRequest = (100% - currentSoC) * capacity
```
Positive = needs charging, Negative = can discharge, Zero = level reached.

**4. V2G Discharge Constraints:**
```
Can discharge = (evMinDischargingRequest < 0)
              AND (evMaxDischargingRequest >= 0)
              AND (evTargetEnergyRequest <= 0 OR evDischargeBelowTargetPermitted)
```
From EEBUS DBEVC / ISO 15118-20 cycle protection rules.

**5. Demand Mode Indicator:**
```
NONE                  - IEC 61851 (no demand info)
SINGLE_DEMAND         - Basic energy request
SCHEDULED             - ISO 15118 scheduled mode (EV plans)
DYNAMIC               - ISO 15118-20 dynamic mode (CEM controls)
DYNAMIC_BIDIRECTIONAL - ISO 15118-20 with V2G
```
Tells EMS what level of optimization is possible.

**EEBUS Use Case Coverage:**

| Use Case | Mapping |
|----------|---------|
| EVSOC | evStateOfCharge, evBatteryCapacity, evMin/Target/MaxEnergyRequest |
| EVCS | sessionEnergyCharged, sessionId |
| SMR | sessionId links to Measurement data |
| EVCC/EVSECC | evIdentifications, sessionId |
| CEVC | evMin/Target/MaxEnergyRequest, evDepartureTime, evDemandMode |
| DBEVC | evMin/MaxDischargingRequest, evDischargeBelowTargetPermitted |

**Now Covered by DEC-033:**
- CEVC incentive tables → **Signals (COMBINED) + Tariff features**
- CEVC charging plan curves → **Plan feature**
- CEVC/DBEVC power schedules → **Signals (CONSTRAINT type)**

**Rationale:**
- Accommodates all EV charging protocols in single feature
- Multiple identifications reflect real-world where EVs provide several IDs
- Energy request semantics match ISO 15118-20 for consistency
- V2G constraints essential for bidirectional charging use cases
- Demand mode indicator enables protocol-appropriate optimization

**Resolves:** OPEN-001 (Feature Definitions) - ChargingSession feature now defined, completing all initial features

---

### DEC-033: Signals, Tariff, and Plan Features

**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Status:** Accepted (Updated)

**Context:** Need to support time-based pricing (ToUT), power envelopes (POEN), coordinated EV charging (CEVC), and power forecasts. These scenarios share common data patterns (time slots) but differ in purpose and data direction.

**Research Findings:**

*EEBUS:*
- IncentiveTable with Tariff, Tiers, TierBoundaries, Incentives
- IncentiveTypes: absoluteCost, relativeCost, renewableEnergyPercentage, co2Emission
- Separate Bill feature for cost component breakdown

*Matter:*
- CommodityTariff: Structure (DayPatterns, CalendarPeriods, TariffComponents, PowerThresholds)
- CommodityPrice: Current price + forecast (up to 56 slots)
- DeviceEnergyManagement: Forecast with SlotStruct, PowerAdjustRequest, ConstraintBasedForecast

*ISO 15118 insight:*
- In CEVC, the EV is the optimizer (not the EMS)
- EMS sends incentives/limits TO EVSE via MASH
- EVSE translates to SA_ScheduleTuple via ISO 15118 TO EV
- EV returns ChargingProfile via ISO 15118 TO EVSE
- EVSE translates to Plan via MASH TO EMS

*Real-world tariffs:*
- Components vary independently: energy (~31%), grid fees (~28%), taxes/levies (~41%)
- Power-based tiers common (different rate above X kW)
- Feed-in tariffs separate from consumption tariffs
- CO2 intensity and renewable percentage increasingly important

**Options Evaluated:**
1. Single Schedule feature with all fields (bidirectional)
2. Separate features: PriceSchedule, PowerSchedule, Forecast
3. Two features: Schedule (time-varying values) + Tariff (stable structure)
4. Three features: Signals (IN) + Plan (OUT) + Tariff (stable structure)

**Decision:** Three features - Signals, Tariff, and Plan

The key insight is **data direction**:
- **Signals** = data flowing IN to device (from controllers)
- **Plan** = data flowing OUT from device (to controllers)
- **Tariff** = stable structure (rarely changes)

**Tariff Feature (0x0007):**
- Defines price structure separately from time-varying values
- Components: ENERGY, GRID_FEE, TAX, LEVY, CO2, CREDIT
- Power tiers for demand-based pricing
- Separate consumption and production (feed-in) tariffs
- Signals references Tariff for component IDs

**Signals Feature (0x0008):**
- Time-slotted INPUT data from controllers
- Five signal types: PRICE, CONSTRAINT, TARGET, FORECAST, COMBINED
- Supports multiple concurrent signals from different sources
- Resolution rules: most restrictive for limits, highest priority for prices
- SignalSlot fields: prices, limits, targets, forecasts, environmental signals

**Plan Feature (0x0009):**
- Time-slotted OUTPUT data from device
- Device's intended behavior in response to Signals
- For EVSE: reflects EV's ISO 15118 ChargingProfile
- PlanSlot fields: plannedConsumption/Production, expectedSoC
- Events notify controllers when plan changes

**Use Case Coverage:**

| Use Case | Feature(s) | Direction | Key Data |
|----------|------------|-----------|----------|
| ToUT (time-of-use tariff) | Signals (PRICE) + Tariff | IN | componentPrices per slot |
| POEN (power envelope) | Signals (CONSTRAINT) | IN | min/maxConsumption/Production |
| CEVC input | Signals (COMBINED) + Tariff | IN | prices + limits + forecast |
| CEVC output (EV plan) | Plan | OUT | plannedConsumption, expectedSoC |
| Solar forecast | Signals (FORECAST) | IN | forecastProduction, confidence |
| Load forecast | Signals (FORECAST) | IN | forecastConsumption |
| Grid CO2 forecast | Signals (FORECAST) | IN | co2Intensity |

**CEVC Flow:**
```
EMS --> SetSignal(COMBINED) --> EVSE --> SA_ScheduleTuple --> EV
                                     <-- ChargingProfile <--
    <-- Plan (via RequestPlan) <--
```

**EEBUS/Matter Coverage:**

| Source | MASH Mapping |
|--------|--------------|
| EEBUS ToUT | Signals (PRICE) + Tariff |
| EEBUS POEN | Signals (CONSTRAINT) |
| EEBUS CEVC IncentiveTable | Signals (COMBINED) + Tariff |
| EEBUS CEVC ChargingPlan | Plan |
| Matter CommodityTariff | Tariff |
| Matter CommodityPrice | Signals (PRICE) |
| Matter DeviceEnergyManagement.Forecast | Signals (FORECAST) / Plan |

**Rationale:**
- Direction-based split (IN vs OUT) clarifies data flow semantics
- Matches ISO 15118 model where EV optimizes, not EMS
- Separating structure (Tariff) from values (Signals) matches real-world contracts
- Power tiers essential for demand-based pricing (common in Europe)
- Plan feature enables EMS to integrate device intentions into overall planning

**Declined Alternatives:**
- Single bidirectional Schedule feature: Confuses input vs output semantics
- Extending EnergyControl: Conflates control with information
- Per-type schedule features: Redundant structures

**Resolves:** Open Question #7 (Scheduled Limits)

### DEC-034: Explicit Control State and Optional Process Lifecycle

**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Analyzing EEBUS OHPCF (Optimization of Self-Consumption by Heat Pump Compressor Flexibility) and LPC (Limitation of Power Consumption) revealed two design problems in EEBUS:

1. **LPC's heartbeat-based state inference is bad**: EEBUS LPC uses heartbeats and implicit state transitions - the controller infers device state (Init, Limited, Failsafe, Unlimited) rather than reading it directly. This causes race conditions, debugging difficulty, and no single source of truth.

2. **OHPCF requires optional process lifecycle management**: Heat pumps, water heaters, and similar devices have "optional" tasks (e.g., "I could run the compressor now") that controllers schedule. This needs explicit task lifecycle tracking.

**Options Evaluated:**

*For control state:*
1. Keep EEBUS implicit heartbeat model (controller infers state)
2. Report operational state only (OFFLINE/ONLINE/FAULT)
3. Report explicit control relationship state (device tells you its control status)

*For process lifecycle:*
1. Extend Pause/Resume commands with implicit state
2. Add explicit ProcessStateEnum with full lifecycle tracking
3. Separate status/control features

**Decision:**

1. **ControlStateEnum** - explicit control relationship state reported by device:
   - `AUTONOMOUS` (0x00): Not under external control
   - `CONTROLLED` (0x01): Under controller authority, no active limit
   - `LIMITED` (0x02): Active power limit being applied
   - `FAILSAFE` (0x03): Connection lost, using failsafe limits
   - `OVERRIDE` (0x04): Device overriding for safety/legal/self-protection

2. **ProcessStateEnum** - explicit optional task lifecycle:
   - `NONE` (0x00): No optional process available
   - `AVAILABLE` (0x01): Process announced, not scheduled
   - `SCHEDULED` (0x02): Start time configured, waiting
   - `RUNNING` (0x03): Process executing
   - `PAUSED` (0x04): Paused by controller
   - `COMPLETED` (0x05): Finished successfully
   - `ABORTED` (0x06): Stopped/cancelled

3. **Failsafe configuration** - device knows what to do when controller disappears:
   - `failsafeConsumptionLimit`: limit to apply in FAILSAFE
   - `failsafeProductionLimit`: limit to apply in FAILSAFE
   - `failsafeDuration`: time in FAILSAFE before transitioning to AUTONOMOUS (2-24h)

4. **OptionalProcess struct** - for announcing optional tasks:
   - Process identification (id, description)
   - Power characteristics (estimate, min, max)
   - Timing constraints (duration, minRunDuration, minPauseDuration)
   - Control constraints (isPausable, isStoppable)
   - Energy characteristics (estimate, resumeEnergyPenalty)

5. **New commands**:
   - `Stop`: Abort task completely (vs Pause which can resume)
   - `ScheduleProcess`: Schedule an optional process to start
   - `CancelProcess`: Cancel a scheduled/running process

**Rationale:**

*Why explicit state reporting:*
- Single source of truth: device state is what device reports, not inferred
- No race conditions: no ambiguity about which state applies
- Debuggable: inspect state directly, no need to trace heartbeat history
- Universal: same ControlStateEnum works for LPC, EVSE, battery, heat pump, inverter

*Why separate ControlStateEnum from OperatingStateEnum (Status feature):*
- ControlStateEnum = "Am I being externally controlled?"
- OperatingStateEnum = "Am I working correctly?"
- Orthogonal concerns: device can be RUNNING (operational) but AUTONOMOUS (not controlled)

*Why ProcessStateEnum is orthogonal to ControlStateEnum:*
- Device can be LIMITED (control state) while process is RUNNING (task lifecycle)
- Or FAILSAFE (control state) with process PAUSED (task lifecycle)
- Different concerns: connection status vs task execution

*Failsafe rationale:*
- Devices MUST know what to do when controller disappears
- Pre-configured failsafe limits ensure safety
- Duration prevents devices being stuck in FAILSAFE forever
- Applicable to ALL device types: EVSE (stop charging after X hours), battery (discharge limits), heat pump (min heating)

**EEBUS Use Case Coverage:**

| EEBUS | MASH | Improvement |
|-------|------|-------------|
| LPC heartbeat state machine | ControlStateEnum | Explicit, not inferred |
| LPC failsafe by timeout | failsafeDuration → AUTONOMOUS | Same behavior, explicit |
| LPC "limited" state | controlState = LIMITED | Direct reading |
| OHPCF SmartEnergyManagementPs | OptionalProcess + ProcessStateEnum | Cleaner model |
| OHPCF power sequence state | processState | Explicit lifecycle |
| COB failsafe state | ControlStateEnum.FAILSAFE | Unified across device types |

**Declined Alternatives:**

- Heartbeat-based inference: Fundamentally flawed - no single source of truth
- Combined state enum: Conflates control relationship with task lifecycle
- Per-device-type state handling: Redundant, same concept applies universally

### DEC-035: Matter-Style Capability Discovery

**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Status:** Accepted (updated by DEC-050)

**Context:** MASH has multiple features (EnergyControl, Measurement, Signals, Tariff, Plan, etc.) with many optional attributes. Controllers need to know:
- Which features a device implements
- Which optional attributes are present within each feature
- Which commands the device accepts
- Device capabilities without reading each attribute individually

**Options Evaluated:**

1. **EEBUS approach**: nodeManagementUseCaseData to advertise use cases by name
2. **Trial and error**: Controller reads attributes and handles errors for missing ones
3. **Matter-style global attributes**: FeatureMap bitmap + attribute/command lists

**Decision:** Matter-style global attributes on every endpoint.

**Global Attributes (reserved IDs 0xFFF0-0xFFFF):**

| Attribute | ID | Type | Description |
|-----------|-----|------|-------------|
| `featureMap` | 0xFFFC | bitmap32 | Supported optional features |
| `attributeList` | 0xFFFB | array[uint16] | Implemented attribute IDs |
| `acceptedCommandList` | 0xFFFA | array[uint8] | Accepted command IDs |
| `generatedCommandList` | 0xFFF9 | array[uint8] | Response command IDs |
| `eventList` | 0xFFF8 | array[uint8] | Supported event IDs |

> **Note:** `clusterRevision` (0xFFFD) was originally included here but removed by DEC-050. Protocol versioning is handled by a single `specVersion` attribute in DeviceInfo (major.minor format) and ALPN negotiation. Per-feature revisions are tracked in the spec as a version manifest per release, not on the wire.

**FeatureMap Bits:**

```
bit 0  (0x0001): CORE      - EnergyCore basics (always set)
bit 1  (0x0002): FLEX      - FlexibilityStruct support
bit 2  (0x0004): BATTERY   - Battery attributes (SoC, SoH)
bit 3  (0x0008): EMOB      - E-Mobility/EVSE
bit 4  (0x0010): SIGNALS   - Incentive signals
bit 5  (0x0020): TARIFF    - Tariff data
bit 6  (0x0040): PLAN      - Power plan
bit 7  (0x0080): PROCESS   - Optional process lifecycle (OHPCF)
bit 8  (0x0100): FORECAST  - Power forecasting
bit 9  (0x0200): ASYMMETRIC - Per-phase asymmetric control
bit 10 (0x0400): V2X       - Vehicle-to-grid/home
```

**Discovery Flow:**
1. Read endpoint list to discover device structure
2. Read `specVersion` from DeviceInfo (endpoint 0) for protocol version
3. For each endpoint, read `featureMap` for quick capability check
4. Read `attributeList` for fine-grained attribute discovery
5. Read `acceptedCommandList` to know which commands work

**Rationale:**

*Why Matter-style:*
- Self-describing: Controller knows exactly what's available without trial/error
- Version-safe: `specVersion` in DeviceInfo provides protocol version; `attributeList` handles capability discovery (see DEC-050)
- Fine-grained: `attributeList` gives exact attribute availability
- Compact: Bitmap `featureMap` is efficient for quick checks
- Predictable: No implicit assumptions about device type implications

*Why not EEBUS nodeManagementUseCaseData:*
- EEBUS is coarse-grained (use case level, not attribute level)
- Use case "support" is ambiguous (which scenarios? which functions?)
- No version negotiation per use case
- Requires out-of-band spec lookup to know what attributes exist

*Why not trial and error:*
- Wastes roundtrips on error responses
- Error handling complexity
- No way to show user what device can do before trying

**Feature-Dependent Conformance:**

| Attribute | Mandatory If | Optional If |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `stateOfCharge`, `stateOfHealth` | BATTERY | - |
| `sessionEnergy`, `evseState` | EMOB | - |
| `flexibility` | - | FLEX |
| `forecast` | - | FORECAST |
| `processState`, `optionalProcess` | PROCESS | - |
| Phase setpoint attributes | ASYMMETRIC | - |

**Declined Alternatives:**

- EEBUS use case discovery: Too coarse, no version handling, requires spec lookup
- Trial and error: Inefficient, poor UX, no proactive capability display
- Capability negotiation at connection time: Adds connection complexity

### DEC-036: Charging Mode and Responsibility Model

**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** OSCEV 2.0 adds PV charging mode support - letting users choose optimization strategies (PV surplus only, PV with threshold, fast charging). This raises questions about:
- Where does charging mode configuration belong?
- Who controls what between CEM and EVSE?
- How to handle EV-specific timing constraints?

**Options Evaluated:**

1. **CEM controls everything**: CEM sets mode and timing, EVSE just executes
2. **EVSE controls everything**: EVSE handles optimization based on hints from CEM
3. **Split responsibility**: CEM sets goals, EVSE implements using domain knowledge

**Decision:** Split responsibility with "CEM suggests, EVSE decides within safe bounds" pattern.

**Additions to ChargingSession Feature:**

```cbor
// CHARGING MODE (optimization strategy)
70: chargingMode,            // ChargingModeEnum: active optimization strategy
71: supportedChargingModes,  // ChargingModeEnum[]: modes EVSE supports
72: surplusThreshold,        // int64 mW?: threshold for PV_SURPLUS_THRESHOLD

// START/STOP DELAYS (CEM can override, EVSE enforces)
80: startDelay,              // uint32 s: delay before (re)starting charge
81: stopDelay,               // uint32 s: delay before pausing charge
```

**ChargingModeEnum:**
```
OFF                   = 0x00  // No optimization, charge at maximum rate
PV_SURPLUS_ONLY       = 0x01  // Only self-produced energy, no grid
PV_SURPLUS_THRESHOLD  = 0x02  // Allow grid if surplus >= surplusThreshold
PRICE_OPTIMIZED       = 0x03  // Optimize based on price signals
SCHEDULED             = 0x04  // Follow time-based schedule/plan
```

**Responsibility Model:**

| Domain | Owner | Responsibility |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| System optimization | CEM/EMS | Goals, prices, grid constraints, PV forecasts |
| EV behavior | EVSE | Protocol handling, timing, hardware limits |

- **CEM sets** charging mode and can override delays
- **EVSE validates** requests against EV/hardware constraints
- **EVSE enforces** behavior using its domain knowledge
- **EVSE reports** active mode, constraints, and deviations
- EVSE may **reject** values that would harm the EV

**Rationale:**

*Why split responsibility:*
- Each party contributes expertise from their domain
- CEM doesn't need to know EV-specific timing details
- EVSE can protect EV from harmful requests
- Similar to failsafe pattern already in EnergyControl

*Why start/stop delays:*
- Prevents EVs from stopping completely due to frequent PV-induced interruptions
- EVSE knows connected EV's requirements
- CEM can override if system needs demand, EVSE still enforces safety

**EEBUS Coverage:**

| OSCEV 2.0 Scenario | MASH Mapping |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Scenario 5 - PV Charge Mode | chargingMode, surplusThreshold |
| Scenario 6 - Start/Stop Delays | startDelay, stopDelay |

**Declined Alternatives:**

- CEM controls everything: CEM lacks EV-specific knowledge
- EVSE controls everything: Misses system-wide optimization opportunities
- Separate feature for charging mode: Overcomplicates; logically part of session

### DEC-036b: Dynamic Electrical Feature for Connected Devices

**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** When an EV connects to an EVSE, the system's effective capability changes (e.g., 22kW EVSE + 7.4kW EV = 7.4kW effective max). Where should EV constraints (min/max power, min/max current) be reported?

**Options Evaluated:**

1. **ChargingSession**: Add `evMinChargingPower`, `evMaxChargingPower`, etc.
2. **EnergyControl**: Dynamic constraint fields
3. **Electrical**: Existing fields update when EV connects

**Decision:** Electrical feature is dynamic and reflects current system capability.

**Design:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Electrical (capability)                                     │
│   → "What CAN this endpoint do right now?"                  │
│   → Dynamic: updates when connected device changes          │
│   → nominalMaxConsumption, maxCurrentPerPhase, etc.         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ EnergyControl (policy)                                      │
│   → "What SHOULD this endpoint do?"                         │
│   → CEM-set limits and setpoints                            │
│   → Must be within Electrical's envelope                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Rationale:**

*Why Electrical:*
- It's truly a capability change, not a policy change
- "What CAN this endpoint do" naturally includes connected devices
- No field duplication across features
- CEM subscribes to Electrical, sees capability changes automatically
- Clean separation: capability vs policy

*Why not ChargingSession:*
- Would duplicate min/max fields that already exist in Electrical
- CEM would have to calculate effective range itself
- Mixes session state with system capability

*Why not EnergyControl:*
- EnergyControl is for CEM-set policy, not physical capability
- Would blur the line between "what's possible" and "what's allowed"

**Example flow:**
1. EVSE reports Electrical with hardware limits (22kW, 32A)
2. EV connects with 7.4kW/16A max, 1.4kW/6A min
3. EVSE updates Electrical: `nominalMaxConsumption=7400000`, `maxCurrentPerPhase=16000`, `nominalMinPower=1400000`
4. CEM (subscribed) sees change, adjusts limits accordingly
5. EV disconnects → Electrical returns to EVSE hardware limits

### DEC-037: Two-Level Capability Discovery Pattern

**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** With multiple capability flags across features (asymmetric support, V2X, bidirectional, charging modes), controllers need efficient discovery. Should all details be in featureMap bits, or distributed between featureMap and attributes?

**Options Evaluated:**

1. **Fine-grained featureMap**: Separate bits for every capability variant (ASYMMETRIC_CHARGING, ASYMMETRIC_DISCHARGING, ASYMMETRIC_BIDIRECTIONAL, etc.)
2. **Coarse-grained featureMap**: High-level bits (ASYMMETRIC) with details in attributes
3. **No featureMap**: All discovery via attribute reading

**Decision:** Two-level capability discovery with 32-bit featureMap.

**Pattern:**
- **FeatureMap** (32-bit bitmap) = high-level category check ("does it support this?")
- **Feature attributes** = detailed capability information ("how exactly?")

**FeatureMap Bits (high-level):**
```
ASYMMETRIC (0x0200) → "Supports per-phase control"
V2X (0x0400)        → "Supports bidirectional EV"
EMOB (0x0008)       → "Has EV charging"
```

**Detailed Information (in attributes):**
```
Electrical.supportsAsymmetric: NONE/CONSUMPTION/PRODUCTION/BIDIRECTIONAL
Electrical.supportedDirections: CONSUMPTION/PRODUCTION/BIDIRECTIONAL
ChargingSession.supportedChargingModes: [OFF, PV_SURPLUS_ONLY, ...]
ChargingSession.evDemandMode: DYNAMIC_BIDIRECTIONAL
```

**Discovery Flow:**
1. Read `featureMap` → quick check what categories are supported
2. Read relevant feature attributes → get specific capability details

**Example - V2H EVSE with asymmetric charging but symmetric discharging:**
- `featureMap`: CORE | EMOB | ASYMMETRIC | V2X (quick: "yes it does V2X and asymmetric")
- `Electrical.supportsAsymmetric = CONSUMPTION` (detail: "but only for charging")
- `Electrical.supportedDirections = BIDIRECTIONAL` (detail: "can charge and discharge")

**Rationale:**

*Why 32-bit:*
- Aligned with Matter (BITMAP32)
- CBOR encodes small values efficiently anyway
- Room for future expansion (currently 11 bits used)

*Why two levels:*
- FeatureMap for quick filtering ("show me all V2X capable devices")
- Attributes for accurate capability matching ("can it do asymmetric V2G?")
- Prevents combinatorial explosion of featureMap bits
- Detailed enums are more expressive than boolean bits

*Why not all details in featureMap:*
- ASYMMETRIC × V2X × directions = many combinations
- Bits are limited (32), enums are unlimited
- Easier to add new enum values than new featureMap bits

**Declined Alternatives:**

- Fine-grained featureMap: Combinatorial explosion, quickly runs out of bits
- No featureMap: Requires reading many attributes for basic filtering
- 16-bit featureMap: Works for now but limits future expansion

### DEC-038: Command Parameters vs Stored Attributes

**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Commands like `SetLimit` have parameters like `duration` that control behavior. Question: Are these stored and readable like attributes, or transient like Matter's command parameters?

**Protocol Comparison:**

| Protocol | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| **EEBUS** | All function data is stored and readable. Writing to a function persists all fields. No concept of "transient parameters." |
| **Matter** | Commands have parameters that control execution but aren't stored. `transitionTime` in LevelControl is passed at invocation but not readable as an attribute. |

**Options Evaluated:**

1. **EEBUS model**: Store all command parameters as readable attributes (e.g., `limitDuration`, `limitCause`)
2. **Matter model**: Command parameters are transient - control behavior but aren't persisted
3. **Hybrid**: Some parameters stored, some transient

**Decision:** Matter model - command parameters are transient, not stored attributes.

**Design:**

| Concept | Behavior | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Attribute** | Stored, readable, subscribable | `myConsumptionLimit`, `effectiveConsumptionLimit` |
| **Command parameter** | Transient, not readable, controls execution | `duration`, `cause` |

**After SetLimit(consumptionLimit: 5000000, duration: 60, cause: LOCAL_PROTECTION):**
- `myConsumptionLimit` = 5000000 (readable, subscribable)
- `duration` = not accessible (internal timer running)
- `cause` = not accessible (logged but not queryable)

**Implications:**

1. **No "remaining duration" attribute**: Timer is internal, not exposed
2. **Controller tracks expiry locally**: If controller needs to know, it calculates `now + duration`
3. **To change duration**: Re-send entire SetLimit command
4. **To remove timer**: Send SetLimit with `duration: 0` or omit duration
5. **null invalid for command parameters**: Use omission for defaults, not null

**Omitting Optional Parameters:**

| In command | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| Key absent | Use default value |
| Key with value | Use this value |
| Key with `null` | Invalid - don't use null for command parameters |

**Rationale:**

*Why Matter model over EEBUS model:*
- **Simpler device implementation**: Don't need to store/manage every parameter
- **Clearer semantics**: Attributes are state, commands are actions
- **Less state to synchronize**: Transient parameters don't need notification
- **Controller owns scheduling context**: Controller set the duration, controller knows when it expires
- **Matter-aligned**: Familiar pattern for developers

*Why no remaining duration attribute:*
- Would require continuous updates or on-demand calculation
- Adds complexity for marginal benefit
- Controller can track locally (it set the duration)
- Other zones don't need to know when a limit expires - they only care about the effective limit value

**Test Implications:**
- TC-ZONE-LIMIT-6c: Verify duration is NOT readable as an attribute
- TC-ZONE-LIMIT-6a: Verify re-sending command replaces timer

**Declined Alternatives:**

- EEBUS model (all stored): Adds complexity, unclear benefit for transient control parameters
- Hybrid model: Complicates the mental model - either it's state or it's control, not both
- Adding `remainingDuration` attribute: Continuous change or on-demand calculation adds complexity

### DEC-039: State Machine Interaction Rules

**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** MASH has two orthogonal state machines: ControlStateEnum (controller relationship) and ProcessStateEnum (optional task lifecycle). The testability analysis identified that interaction rules were unspecified - what happens to ProcessState when ControlState changes?

**Key Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Question |
|----------|----------|
| Connection lost during RUNNING process | Does process pause or continue? |
| Connection lost during PAUSED process | Does it stay paused or auto-resume on failsafe expiry? |
| Failsafe expires during SCHEDULED process | Does scheduled process still start? |
| Reconnection during active process | Who owns the process? |

**Decision:** Process lifecycle continues independently of ControlState transitions.

**Rules:**

1. **RUNNING processes continue during FAILSAFE**
   - Process operates under failsafe limits (more restrictive)
   - Process can complete during FAILSAFE
   - Rationale: Safer to complete (e.g., dishwasher cycle) than leave mid-operation

2. **SCHEDULED processes start as planned during FAILSAFE**
   - Device starts process at scheduledStart without controller confirmation
   - Process runs under failsafe limits
   - Rationale: User expectation is scheduled task runs

3. **PAUSED processes remain paused during FAILSAFE**
   - Device-specific behavior on failsafe expiry (PICS item)
   - Conservative devices: stay paused
   - Aggressive devices: auto-resume
   - PICS: `MASH.S.CTRL.B_PAUSED_AUTO_RESUME`

4. **Reconnection restores control, doesn't cancel**
   - Controller sees process state in subscription priming
   - Controller can interact (Pause, Cancel) but process continues by default
   - Process ownership persists across disconnection

**FAILSAFE Timing Precision:**

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Maximum detection delay | 95 seconds | 3 missed pongs @ 30s + 5s timeout |
| Failsafe timer accuracy | +/- 1% | 24h failsafe = +/- 14 minutes |
| Failsafe limit application | Immediate | Safety-critical, no gradual ramp |
| Reconnection race window | 5 seconds | If handshake completes within 5s of timer, reconnection wins |

**Rationale:**

*Why continue processes:*
- User scheduled the task expecting it to run
- Mid-operation abort can cause problems (wet laundry, half-heated water)
- Failsafe limits provide grid safety regardless
- Controller regains control on reconnection

*Why PAUSED is device-specific:*
- Paused implies intentional stop - conservative to maintain that
- But some devices may want to resume after extended disconnect
- Make it explicit via PICS so controllers know what to expect

**Test Cases:**
- TC-INTERACTION-1 through TC-INTERACTION-15 cover all interaction scenarios
- TC-STATE-5 through TC-STATE-9 cover FAILSAFE behavior
- TC-PROCESS-* cover ProcessState transitions

**Documentation:** See `docs/testing/behavior/state-machines.md` for complete specification.

### DEC-040: Device Identity via Certificate Fingerprint

**Date:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** Proposed

**Context:** Need a stable, verifiable device identity for:
- Reconnection after restarts (controller matches device)
- Certificate pinning/validation
- Persistence of commissioned device relationships

**Options Evaluated:**
1. Subject Key Identifier (SKI) - 20-byte hash of public key
2. Full certificate fingerprint - SHA-256 hash of entire certificate
3. PASE-derived ID - hash of SPAKE2+ shared secret

**Decision:** Full certificate fingerprint (SHA-256)

**Rationale:**
- More collision-resistant than SKI (32 bytes vs 20 bytes)
- Covers entire certificate content, not just public key
- Standard practice for certificate pinning
- If certificate changes (renewal, rotation), identity changes appropriately
- Easy to compute: `sha256(certificate.Raw)` in Go

**Implementation:**
- Device generates/loads persistent TLS certificate on startup
- Device ID = hex-encoded SHA-256 of DER-encoded certificate
- Controller stores device's certificate fingerprint during commissioning
- On reconnection, controller verifies fingerprint matches

**Declined Alternatives:**
- SKI: Smaller but less collision-resistant, only covers public key
- PASE-derived: Different for each commissioning session, not tied to certificate

**Related:** OPEN-002 (Certificate and Session Details)

### DEC-041: Bidirectional Feature Access and Topology-Based Permissions

**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need to support hierarchical controller scenarios where:
1. SMGW (Grid Operator) controls an EMS by setting grid power limits
2. EMS controls downstream devices (EVSE, heat pump, battery)
3. EMS can read SMGW's grid meter values to optimize within grid limits

This raised questions about:
- Can both sides of a connection expose and access features?
- What permission model governs who can access what?
- How do we handle a device in multiple controller zones?

**Options Evaluated:**

1. **Zone-Type Priority Inheritance**
   - Higher priority zones inherit all permissions of lower priority
   - Simple but too coarse-grained

2. **Feature-Declared Permissions (ACL)**
   - Each feature declares which zone types can Read/Write/Subscribe/Invoke
   - Fine-grained but verbose configuration overhead

3. **Capability Grants in Certificate**
   - Certificates include explicit capability grants
   - Maximum flexibility but complex certificate management

4. **Hybrid (Defaults + Feature Overrides)**
   - Zone-type defaults with per-feature exceptions
   - Good balance but adds permission layer complexity

5. **Topology-Based Implicit Permissions**
   - Commissioning defines access; no explicit permission model
   - Simplest approach if topology naturally enforces access patterns

**Decision:** Topology-Based Implicit Permissions (Option 5)

**Rationale:**

The key insight is that **commissioning IS authorization**. The network topology naturally enforces access control:

1. **Controllers control devices in their zone** - If you commissioned a device, you can control it (Read/Write/Subscribe/Invoke). This is implicit.

2. **Devices connect only to controllers** - Devices cannot connect to other devices. There is no device-to-device communication path.

3. **Dual-service entities** - An EMS that needs to both control devices AND be controlled runs two separate services:
   - A ControllerService (manages its own zone with downstream devices)
   - A DeviceService (can be commissioned into another controller's zone)

   These services are independent. Devices in the EMS's zone cannot see or access the EMS's device-side features - they're on different connections entirely.

4. **Multi-zone conflict resolution already exists** - When a device belongs to multiple zones (e.g., EVSE in both SMGW and EMS zones), the existing rules apply:
   - Limits: Most restrictive wins (DEC-024)
   - Setpoints: Highest priority zone wins

**Example Architecture:**

```
SMGW (Smart Meter Gateway)
├── ControllerService (GRID zone)
│   └── controls: EMS-DeviceService
│       └── Can write grid limits to EMS
│
└── DeviceService (exposes grid meter)
    └── commissioned into: EMS zone
        └── EMS can read meter values

EMS (Energy Management System)
├── ControllerService (LOCAL zone)
│   ├── controls: SMGW-DeviceService (meter) → reads grid meter
│   ├── controls: EVSE
│   └── controls: Heat Pump
│
└── DeviceService (exposes GRID_CONNECTION aggregate)
    └── commissioned into: SMGW zone
        └── SMGW can write limits, read aggregate
```

**Wire Protocol Implications:**

The wire protocol already supports bidirectional message flow (audit confirmed):
- Message framing is symmetric
- No role/direction fields in messages
- MessageID spaces are independent per side

Service layer changes needed:
- Sessions must handle all message types (Request, Response, Notification)
- Both sides can send Read/Write/Subscribe/Invoke
- No permission checks needed beyond "is this a valid commissioned connection?"

**What We DON'T Need:**

| Eliminated Complexity | Reason |
|----------------------|--------|
| Explicit permission model | Topology defines access |
| Feature-level ACLs | All features accessible to commissioned controller |
| Zone-type permission matrix | Commissioning grants full access |
| ExposeToRemote flags | Features visible on connection, no filtering |
| Capability certificates | Zone type sufficient for conflict resolution |

**What We DO Need:**

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Multi-zone limit resolution | Already implemented (DEC-024) |
| Multi-zone setpoint resolution | Already implemented |
| Dual-service support | Application-level composition |
| Bidirectional message handling | Service layer refactoring needed |

**Declined Alternatives:**

- **Feature ACLs**: Unnecessary complexity when topology already constrains access
- **Certificate capabilities**: Over-engineering for current use cases
- **Zone-type permission matrix**: Adds a layer that topology already provides

**Key Principle:** The act of commissioning a device into your zone IS the authorization. No additional permission layer required.

### DEC-042: Pairing Request Mechanism for Deferred Commissioning

**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The original commissioning window duration (120 seconds) is too short for real-world installation scenarios:

1. **Energy devices take time to install** - EVSE, heat pumps, inverters require significant setup before pairing
2. **SMGW commissioning is deferred** - QR code is scanned at installation, but SMGW may not receive credentials for days or weeks
3. **Matter's approach insufficient** - Even Matter's 48-hour extended window doesn't solve the SMGW scenario

The EEBUS SHIP Pairing Service was analyzed as a reference. It uses a separate `_shippairing` mDNS service where the controller (devZ) announces a pairing request, and the device (devA) listens and responds. This inverts the traditional "device opens window, controller connects" model.

**Options Evaluated:**

1. **Longer commissioning window (Matter-style)**
   - Extend window to 48 hours for uncommissioned devices
   - Problem: Still doesn't solve weeks-long SMGW delays
   - Problem: Continuous advertising wastes resources

2. **Always-open window until first commissioning**
   - Device stays in commissioning mode indefinitely
   - Problem: No way to re-commission for additional zones
   - Problem: Security concerns (window never closes)

3. **Pairing request mechanism (EEBUS-inspired)**
   - Controller announces "I want to pair with device X"
   - Device listens, opens window when it sees matching request
   - Solves arbitrary delay scenarios
   - Unified mechanism for all commissioning scenarios

4. **Authenticated pairing request (HMAC)**
   - Add HMAC to pairing request using a separate secret
   - Problem: Low-entropy passcode enables offline brute-force if used for HMAC
   - Problem: Separate secret adds QR code complexity

**Decision:** Pairing Request Mechanism (Option 3) without authentication (Option 4 rejected)

**Rationale:**

The pairing request is a "wake up" signal, not an authentication mechanism. Security is provided by PASE:

1. **PASE authenticates commissioning** - Only controllers with the correct passcode can complete PASE
2. **Physical access required** - Passcode comes from QR code on device
3. **Opening window is not a breach** - Attacker without passcode cannot complete commissioning
4. **Equivalent to Matter security** - Matter opens windows without HMAC; PASE is the gatekeeper

**Design:**

New service type: `_mashp._udp` (pairing request)

| TXT Key | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `D` | Target discriminator (which device should respond) |
| `ZI` | Zone ID (who is requesting) |
| `ZN` | Zone name (optional, for display) |

**Device behavior:**
- Listen for `_mashp._udp` when uncommissioned or accepting additional zones
- When matching discriminator seen: open commissioning window, start advertising `_mashc._udp`
- Default window duration: 3 hours (configurable 1-24 hours)

**Controller behavior:**
- Browse `_mashc._udp` first
- If device not found: announce `_mashp._udp` with target discriminator
- Continue until device appears or timeout

**Commissioning Flow:**

```
Standard:
1. Scan QR → discriminator + passcode
2. Browse _mashc._udp → find device
3. Connect, PASE with passcode

Deferred (SMGW scenario):
1. QR scan → data to backend → [days/weeks] → SMGW provisioned
2. SMGW browses _mashc._udp → NOT found
3. SMGW announces _mashp._udp with D=<discriminator>
4. Device sees request → opens window → advertises _mashc._udp
5. SMGW discovers device → connect, PASE with passcode
```

**Commissioning Window Duration:**

Changed default from 120 seconds to 3 hours because:
- Energy devices (EVSE, heat pumps) require significant installation time
- Pairing rarely happens immediately after power-on
- 3 hours accommodates realistic installer workflows
- Configurable range: 1-24 hours

**What We Avoided:**

| Rejected Complexity | Reason |
|--------------------|--------|
| Separate pairing secret | PASE already authenticates; adds QR complexity |
| HMAC on pairing request | Low-entropy passcode enables offline brute-force |
| Complex state machine | Simple "listen and respond" model sufficient |
| Window expiration events | Device just stops advertising when window closes |

### DEC-043: One Zone Per Zone Type Constraint

**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** With the simplified zone type model (GRID, LOCAL), we need to define how many zones a device can belong to.

The original design allowed up to 5 zones per device. However, this creates complexity:
- Multiple SMGWs controlling the same device (whose limits apply?)
- Multiple EMSs controlling the same device (conflicting optimization strategies)
- Complex multi-zone conflict resolution logic

**Decision:** A device can belong to at most **one zone per zone type**:
- Max 1 GRID zone (typically SMGW/grid operator)
- Max 1 LOCAL zone (typically EMS/home app)
- **Total: 2 zones maximum per device**

**Rationale:**

1. **GRID zones are regulatory** - A device should only be subject to one grid operator's control. Multiple grid authorities would create conflicting requirements.

2. **LOCAL zones optimize** - One EMS should manage local energy optimization. Multiple EMSs would have competing strategies.

3. **Simplifies conflict resolution** - With only 2 zones (one per type), the rules are clear:
   - GRID limits always apply (safety/regulatory)
   - LOCAL optimizes within GRID constraints
   - No need for complex N-way conflict resolution

4. **Matches real-world topology** - A device is typically at one grid connection point (one SMGW) and managed by one local system (one EMS).

**Enforcement:**

When a device receives a commissioning request:
1. Check if a zone of the same type already exists
2. If yes: reject commissioning (device already has a zone of this type)
3. If no: proceed with commissioning

**What This Replaces:**

| Old | New |
|-----|-----|
| MaxZones = 5 | MaxZones = 2 |
| Any combination of zones | One GRID + one LOCAL |
| Complex N-way conflict resolution | Simple two-zone priority |

**Migration:** Devices with >2 zones would need to decommission excess zones. This is unlikely in practice since the old limit was rarely used.

**Related:** DEC-024 (Limit Resolution), DEC-023 (Zone Terminology)

### DEC-044: Message Correlation and Request Timeouts

**Date:** 2026-01-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The protocol needs clear rules for message correlation (matching responses to requests) and handling unresponsive connections.

**Questions Addressed:**
1. How does a client correlate responses to requests?
2. What happens when MessageID wraps around (uint32 overflow)?
3. How long should a client wait for a response?

**Decisions:**

**1. Message Correlation via MessageID**

Every request includes a `messageId` (uint32). The response echoes this value:
- Request: `{1: 12345, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: [...]}` (messageId=12345)
- Response: `{1: 12345, 2: 0, 3: {...}}` (same messageId)

This is an implicit ACK/NACK system:
- Response with Status=0 → ACK (success)
- Response with Status≠0 → NACK (error with reason code)
- No separate ACK message type needed

**2. MessageID Space**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Range | 1 to 4,294,967,295 |
| Reserved | 0 (indicates notification) |
| Scope | Per-connection, per-direction |
| Overflow behavior | Wrap to 1 (skip 0) |

**Why 32-bit instead of 64-bit:**
- Target hardware is 32-bit MCUs (DEC-003)
- CBOR: 32-bit = 5 bytes, 64-bit = 9 bytes per message
- Matter uses 32-bit counters
- With 10s timeout, even 10,000 req/s only has ~100K in-flight (vs 4.3B available)

**3. Request Timeout**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Default timeout | 10 seconds |

Timeout behavior:
1. No response within 10s → connection is broken
2. Client SHOULD close and reconnect
3. Client MUST re-send pending requests after reconnection

**Rationale:**
- Devices MUST respond to every request (the protocol has no "fire and forget")
- A missing response means the connection failed, not that the device is slow
- 10 seconds allows for slow operations while maintaining responsiveness

**Comparison:**

| Protocol | Correlation | Timeout |
|----------|------------|---------|
| MASH | MessageID (uint32) | 10 seconds |
| Matter | Transaction ID (uint32) | Configurable per interaction |
| EEBUS SHIP | Complex listHeader + headerFields | Heartbeat-based |

**Related:** DEC-003 (Target Hardware), DEC-008 (Interaction Model)

### DEC-045: Transport-Layer Heartbeat Sufficient for Failsafe

**Date:** 2026-01-28
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** EEBUS LPC and LPP use application-layer heartbeats (DeviceDiagnosis) with 60-second intervals, bidirectionally between Energy Guard and Controllable System. MASH has transport-layer ping/pong (30s interval, 95s max detection). Question: Does MASH need additional application-layer heartbeats for failsafe triggering?

**EEBUS LPC/LPP Heartbeat Model:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Heartbeat interval | ≤60 seconds |
| Failsafe trigger | 120 seconds without heartbeat |
| Direction | Bidirectional (EG↔CS) |
| Purpose | Liveness + gates command processing |

EEBUS requires heartbeat before evaluating commands: "only after a Heartbeat from the Energy Guard, a following received write command within 60 seconds on the Active Power Limit SHALL be evaluated."

**EEBUS Protocol Stack:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Application: LPC/LPP Heartbeat  │  ← 60s, bidirectional
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ SHIP layer                      │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ WebSocket: ping/pong            │  ← transport heartbeat EXISTS
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ TLS                             │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

Note: EEBUS already has transport-layer liveness via WebSocket ping/pong, yet still requires application-layer heartbeats.

**Matter Approach:**

Matter uses subscription liveness (MaxInterval + RTT) for application health, with MRP (Message Reliability Protocol) at transport layer. No feature-specific heartbeats. ICD Check-In exists only for battery-powered devices that sleep for extended periods.

**Options Evaluated:**

1. **EEBUS model**: Add bidirectional application-layer heartbeats, gate commands on heartbeat receipt
2. **Feature-specific heartbeats**: Different heartbeats for different features (as EEBUS does with LPC, LPP, emobility)
3. **Transport-only**: Rely on transport ping/pong for liveness, no application heartbeats
4. **Subscription MaxInterval**: Use existing subscription mechanism as implicit application heartbeat

**Decision:** Transport-layer heartbeat is sufficient. No application-layer heartbeats needed.

**MASH Liveness Mechanisms:**

| Layer | Mechanism | What it proves |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Transport | Ping/pong (30s, 95s max) | TLS connection alive |
| Application | Subscription MaxInterval | Device app processing subscriptions |
| Application | Request/Response (10s timeout) | End-to-end command processing |

**Rationale:**

1. **Command arrival IS proof of liveness.** If a controller can send a Write command, it was alive to send it. Requiring a separate heartbeat before the command adds no information.

2. **Transport heartbeat detects connection failure.** The 95s maximum detection time is acceptable for failsafe purposes. Connection loss triggers FAILSAFE state (DEC-034).

3. **Subscription MaxInterval already serves as device-side heartbeat.** Periodic reports prove the device application is processing. Controllers can set MaxInterval to get regular updates.

4. **Feature-specific heartbeats are redundant.** If the stack can send an LPC heartbeat, it can send an LPC command. Different heartbeats for different features (EEBUS pattern) multiply complexity without adding safety.

5. **EEBUS redundancy is a design flaw, not a feature.** EEBUS has WebSocket ping/pong at transport layer AND application heartbeats. This exists because LPC/LPP were designed by different working groups without clean layering.

6. **Zombie controller edge case is acceptable.** If controller app hangs but TCP stays open, device continues applying last commanded limit. This is safe because:
   - Commanded limits represent explicit controller intent
   - failsafeDuration (2-24h) provides eventual recovery
   - In practice, app crashes usually terminate TCP too

**Edge Case Documentation:**

> If a controller application hangs while the TCP connection remains open, the device will continue applying the last commanded limit until TCP timeout occurs or failsafeDuration expires. This is acceptable because commanded limits represent explicit controller intent, and failsafeDuration provides guaranteed recovery.

**Comparison:**

| Aspect | EEBUS LPC/LPP | MASH |
|--------|---------------|------|
| Transport heartbeat | WebSocket ping/pong | TLS ping/pong (30s) |
| Application heartbeat | DeviceDiagnosis (60s, bidirectional) | None required |
| Failsafe trigger | 120s without app heartbeat | Connection loss (95s max) |
| Command gating | Requires heartbeat first | Commands evaluated immediately |
| State reporting | Inferred from heartbeats | Explicit ControlStateEnum |

**Why EEBUS Requires Both Layers:**

EEBUS uses heartbeats for **semantic gating**, not just liveness: commands are only evaluated after receiving a heartbeat. This pattern was designed to detect "zombie controllers" (app crashed, connection alive). However:

- The gating doesn't prove the controller computed the right limit
- If the controller can send a heartbeat, it can send a command
- MASH's explicit state reporting (DEC-034) eliminates heartbeat-based state inference

**Declined Alternatives:**

- **EEBUS bidirectional heartbeats**: Redundant with transport layer, adds protocol complexity
- **Feature-specific heartbeats**: Multiplies heartbeat traffic without adding safety
- **Heartbeat-gated commands**: If controller can send heartbeat, it can send command - no benefit

### DEC-047: Commissioning Security Hardening

**Date:** 2026-01-29
**Status:** Proposed

**Context:** Security analysis of the commissioning process identified several
hardening opportunities, particularly around DoS protection during the
commissioning window when the device is most vulnerable.

**Options Evaluated:**

1. **No changes** - Accept current design as sufficient
   - Pro: Simpler, no breaking changes
   - Con: Leaves DoS vectors unaddressed

2. **Arbitrary connection limits** - e.g., max 3 commissioning connections
   - Pro: Simple to implement
   - Con: Number is arbitrary, not derived from device capabilities

3. **Zone-based connection model** - Derive limits from zone capacity (CHOSEN)
   - Pro: Logically consistent, resource-bounded, predictable
   - Con: Slightly more complex tracking

**Decision:** Implement zone-based connection model with comprehensive hardening:

**Connection Model:**
- Max operational connections = max_zones (one per paired zone)
- Max commissioning connections = 1 (single concurrent commissioning)
- Total max connections = max_zones + 1
- When zones full: reject commissioning (no advertisement, TLS rejection)

**Additional Hardening:**
- PASE attempt tracking with exponential backoff
- Nonce binding for certificate renewal
- Generic error responses to prevent information leakage
- Explicit handshake timeouts (85s overall)
- Connection cooldown (500ms between attempts)

**Rationale:**
- Connection limits derived from zone capacity are logically defensible
- No wasted effort on commissioning that would fail with ZONE_FULL
- Operational connections never blocked by commissioning activity
- Single commissioning connection minimizes attack surface
- MCU devices (256KB RAM) benefit from predictable resource usage
- Protocol-level fixes ensure all implementations benefit

**Declined Alternatives:**
- Memory-hard functions (Argon2): Excluded due to MCU constraints
- Certificate pinning: Deferred to future release
- Multiple concurrent commissioning: Increases attack surface without benefit

**Related:** DEC-034 (ControlStateEnum), DEC-039 (State Machine Rules)

### DEC-048: Commissioning Window Duration Alignment

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-01-29

**Context:**

MASH originally used a 3-hour default commissioning window. Matter specification 5.4.2.3.1
uses 15 minutes maximum with 3 minutes minimum. With MASH's pairing request mechanism
(`_mashp._udp`), controllers can re-trigger commissioning on demand, making long windows
unnecessary.

**Decision:**

Align commissioning window default with Matter, with MASH-specific maximum:

| Parameter | Before | After | Matter |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Default | 3 hours | 15 minutes | 15 minutes |
| Minimum | 1 hour | 3 minutes | 3 minutes |
| Maximum | 24 hours | 3 hours | 15 minutes |

**Rationale:**
1. **Pairing request provides re-trigger**: `_mashp._udp` allows controllers to request
   commissioning window re-open at any time, eliminating need for long default windows
2. **Reduced attack surface**: Shorter window = less time for PASE brute-force attempts
3. **Spectrum conservation**: Reduces mDNS advertisement pollution on shared spectrum
4. **Matter alignment**: 15 minutes is well-researched for user experience balance
5. **Professional installer support**: 3-hour maximum (vs Matter's 15 min) allows longer
   setup workflows when explicitly configured

**Why MASH allows 3-hour max (vs Matter's 15 min):**
- Professional installer scenarios may require longer setup times
- Pairing request mechanism provides re-triggering if window expires
- No harm in allowing longer windows when explicitly requested

**Consequences:**
- Existing deployments with long setup workflows should use pairing requests
- Test cases using hardcoded 3-hour assumptions need updating
- Default user experience unchanged (pairing request handles window expiry)

**Related:** DEC-047 (Commissioning Security Hardening)

### DEC-049: LPC/LPP Use Case Support - Contractual Limits and Override Tracking

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-01-29

**Context:**

Supporting the EEBUS LPC (Limitation of Power Consumption) and LPP (Limitation of Power Production) use cases for German EnWG §14a compliance. Analysis revealed:

1. LPC and LPP share identical state machines (init, limited, controlled, failsafe, autonomous)
2. `failsafeDuration` is a shared data point between LPC and LPP
3. EEBUS distinguishes hardware limits (devices) from contractual limits (EMS/CEM)
4. Override reasons differ by direction (self-protection for consumption, not production)

**Options Evaluated:**

1. Add contractual limits to Electrical feature
2. Add contractual limits to EnergyControl, keep nominal in Electrical (chosen)
3. Create new GridConnection feature
4. Separate control states per direction (rejected)

**Decision:** Option 2 - Add contractual limits to EnergyControl with unified control state

**Additions to EnergyControl:**
- `contractualConsumptionMax` (attr 73): Building's max allowed consumption (EMS only)
- `contractualProductionMax` (attr 74): Building's max allowed feed-in (EMS only)
- `overrideReason` (attr 75): Why device is in OVERRIDE state
- `overrideDirection` (attr 76): Which direction triggered override
- `OverrideReasonEnum`: SELF_PROTECTION, SAFETY, LEGAL_REQUIREMENT, UNCONTROLLED_LOAD, UNCONTROLLED_PRODUCER
- `LimitRejectReasonEnum`: BELOW_MINIMUM, ABOVE_CONTRACTUAL, INVALID_VALUE, DEVICE_OVERRIDE, NOT_SUPPORTED
- Enhanced `SetLimit` response with `applied`, `rejectReason`, `controlState`

**Rationale:**

1. **Nominal vs Contractual separation:**
   - Nominal max = hardware capability → belongs in Electrical (existing)
   - Contractual max = building's contract → belongs in EnergyControl (added)
   - These are mutually exclusive per EEBUS spec

2. **Unified control state (vs separate per direction):**
   - Single `controlState` shows "most concerning" state (FAILSAFE > OVERRIDE > LIMITED > CONTROLLED > AUTONOMOUS)
   - `overrideDirection` indicates which direction triggered override
   - Simpler for controllers; MASH zone architecture manages both directions together
   - EEBUS complexity (independent state machines) not needed

3. **Shared failsafeDuration:**
   - MASH already models this correctly as single value
   - Matches EEBUS [LPC-022] = [LPP-022]

4. **TLS replaces heartbeat:**
   - EEBUS uses explicit heartbeat (120s timeout)
   - MASH uses TLS connection state - simpler, more reliable
   - Already decided in DEC-045

**LPC/LPP Data Point Mapping:**

| EEBUS | MASH | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| LPC-011 Active Consumption Limit | `myConsumptionLimit` | Exists |
| LPP-011 Active Production Limit | `myProductionLimit` | Exists |
| LPC-021 Failsafe Consumption Limit | `failsafeConsumptionLimit` | Exists |
| LPP-021 Failsafe Production Limit | `failsafeProductionLimit` | Exists |
| LPC/LPP-022 Failsafe Duration | `failsafeDuration` | Shared, exists |
| LPC-041 Nominal Consumption Max | `Electrical.nominalMaxConsumption` | Device only |
| LPP-041 Nominal Production Max | `Electrical.nominalMaxProduction` | Device only |
| LPC-042 Contractual Consumption Max | `contractualConsumptionMax` | **Added**, EMS only |
| LPP-042 Contractual Production Max | `contractualProductionMax` | **Added**, EMS only |

**Declined Alternatives:**

- **Separate control states per direction:** Adds complexity without benefit; MASH's zone architecture means controllers typically manage both directions together
- **Contractual in Electrical:** Electrical is for hardware characteristics, not contract terms
- **New GridConnection feature:** Over-engineering; contractual limits fit naturally in EnergyControl

**Related:** DEC-026 (EnergyControl design), DEC-045 (Failsafe via TLS)

### DEC-050: Protocol Versioning Strategy

**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** OPEN-004 identified version negotiation as an unresolved gap. SPINE's lack of version negotiation causes real interoperability problems. MASH needs a clear versioning strategy that covers:
- How to negotiate the protocol version between controller and device
- How to handle differences in feature capabilities
- How to evolve the protocol without breaking existing deployments

The original design (DEC-035) adopted Matter-style `clusterRevision` as a per-feature global attribute. This works well for Matter, which has hundreds of clusters across independent domains evolving on separate timelines. MASH has 6 tightly coupled features in a single energy domain, making per-feature version tracking unnecessarily complex.

**Options Evaluated:**

1. **Per-feature clusterRevision (Matter-style):** Each feature advertises its own revision number as a global attribute (0xFFFD). Controllers check each feature's revision independently.
2. **Single protocol version only:** One version number (e.g., "1.1") covers all features. No per-feature revision on the wire.
3. **Protocol version on the wire, feature revisions in the spec:** A single protocol version is advertised on the wire. The spec internally tracks per-feature revisions and defines which feature revisions are bundled into each protocol release.

**Decision:** Option 3 - Single protocol version on the wire with per-feature revisions in the spec.

**Protocol Version Format:** `major.minor` (e.g., "1.0", "1.1", "2.0")
- **Major version:** Breaking changes (removing fields, changing semantics). Carried in ALPN string (`mash/1`, `mash/2`).
- **Minor version:** Additive, non-breaking changes (new optional fields, new enum values, new features). Carried in `specVersion` attribute of DeviceInfo.

**Version Manifest (spec-side):**

Each protocol release defines exactly which feature revisions it includes:

```
MASH 1.0:
  DeviceInfo       rev 1
  Electrical       rev 1
  Measurement      rev 1
  EnergyControl    rev 1
  Status           rev 1
  ChargingSession  rev 1
```

Future releases update specific features:

```
MASH 1.1 (example):
  DeviceInfo       rev 1    (unchanged)
  Electrical       rev 2    (added asymmetric phase config)
  Measurement      rev 1    (unchanged)
  EnergyControl    rev 2    (new control mode)
  Status           rev 1    (unchanged)
  ChargingSession  rev 1    (unchanged)
```

**Wire Protocol Changes (relative to DEC-035):**

| Attribute | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `clusterRevision` (0xFFFD) | Per-feature global attribute | **Removed** |
| `featureMap` (0xFFFC) | Per-feature global attribute | Unchanged |
| `attributeList` (0xFFFB) | Per-feature global attribute | Unchanged |
| `acceptedCommandList` (0xFFFA) | Per-feature global attribute | Unchanged |
| `generatedCommandList` (0xFFF9) | Per-feature global attribute | Unchanged |
| `eventList` (0xFFF8) | Per-feature global attribute | Unchanged |
| `specVersion` (DeviceInfo attr 12) | Device spec version | **Becomes the single protocol version** |

**Version Negotiation Flow:**

1. **Connection:** Controller offers ALPN strings for all major versions it supports (e.g., `["mash/2", "mash/1"]`). Device selects the highest mutually supported major version. If no overlap, connection fails.
2. **Discovery:** After connection, controller reads `specVersion` from DeviceInfo (endpoint 0) to learn the exact major.minor version.
3. **Capability check:** Controller uses `featureMap` and `attributeList` to discover the device's actual capabilities. This is more precise than version comparison and handles partial implementations.

**Compatibility Rules:**

- **Same major, higher minor on device:** Controller uses `attributeList` to discover new attributes. Unknown attributes are ignored (forward-compat rules from DEC-035 apply).
- **Same major, lower minor on device:** Controller checks `attributeList` to confirm required attributes exist. Degrades gracefully if newer attributes are absent.
- **Different major:** Handled at ALPN level. No connection if incompatible.

**Rationale:**

*Why not per-feature clusterRevision (Option 1):*
- MASH has 6 features in one domain, not hundreds across independent domains like Matter
- Features are tightly coupled (EnergyControl references Electrical's topology, Measurement depends on Electrical's config)
- Per-feature revisions create a combinatorial compatibility matrix (does EnergyControl rev 2 work with Measurement rev 1?)
- Adds a global attribute to every feature endpoint that constrained devices must serve
- `attributeList` already answers "what do you support?" more precisely than a revision number

*Why not a single version with no feature tracking (Option 2):*
- Feature revisions in the spec help spec authors reason about what changed per feature
- The version manifest makes release notes unambiguous
- Feature-level tracking aids conformance testing

*Why Option 3:*
- One number on the wire: simple for devices, simple for controllers
- No combinatorial explosion: the spec defines valid combinations
- Features still evolve independently in the spec authoring process
- `attributeList` + `featureMap` handle the actual capability discovery
- Aligns with how platform SDKs version (Android API levels, Go releases)

**Declined Alternatives:**

- **ProtocolHello message after TLS:** Adds a roundtrip to every connection. ALPN + `specVersion` in DeviceInfo achieves the same with existing mechanisms.
- **Version field in every message:** Overhead on constrained devices. Protocol version is a session property, not a per-message property.
- **Capability negotiation at connection time:** Adds connection complexity. Better to connect first, discover capabilities through standard attribute reads.

**Related:** DEC-035 (capability discovery - updated by this decision), DEC-002 (simplicity over flexibility), OPEN-004 (resolved)

### DEC-051: Static attributeList Immutability

**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `attributeList` (global attribute 0xFFFB) reports which attribute IDs a feature instance supports. The question arose whether this list can change during a connection -- for example, an EV charger adding measurement attributes when an EV plugs in, or a modular device gaining capabilities at runtime.

This has protocol-wide implications: if `attributeList` can change, controllers must handle dynamic schema changes at runtime (reallocation, null checks for disappearing attributes, re-subscription). If it's static, controllers can read it once and build a stable data model.

**Options Evaluated:**

1. **Static attributeList:** Immutable for the lifetime of a connection. Reflects hardware capabilities, not transient state. Values go `null` when data is temporarily unavailable. Hardware reconfiguration requires connection re-establishment.
2. **Dynamic attributeList:** Can change at runtime. Changes reported via subscription notifications. Controllers must handle structural changes dynamically.

**Decision:** Option 1 - Static attributeList.

**Rules:**

- `attributeList` is immutable for the lifetime of a connection
- It reflects the device's hardware capabilities, not transient runtime state
- Attributes that are supported but currently have no value report `null` (e.g., `evStateOfCharge` is `null` when no EV is plugged in, but remains in `attributeList`)
- A change in hardware configuration (e.g., modular device reconfiguration) requires the device to close and re-establish the connection
- This applies to all features, not just Measurement

**Rationale:**

- **Targets 256KB MCUs (DEC-003):** Static schemas can be allocated once. Dynamic schemas require runtime reallocation.
- **Nullable already handles "unavailable":** The interaction model distinguishes "key absent" (not in message), "key with value" (has data), and "key with null" (explicitly no value). This is sufficient for "supported but currently unavailable."
- **Simplifies subscriptions:** The set of attributes that can appear in delta notifications never changes. No re-subscription needed.
- **Avoids ambiguity:** With dynamic lists, "attribute disappeared" could mean temporarily unavailable, permanently removed, or error. With static lists and nullable values, there's one interpretation: `null` = no current value.
- **PICS conformance stays meaningful:** PICS declarations match runtime reality without conditionals.
- **Matter precedent:** Matter's `AttributeList` is expected to be stable -- transient unavailability is handled through nullable values, not structural changes.

**Declined Alternatives:**

- **Dynamic attributeList:** Requires all controllers to handle schema changes at runtime. Adds complexity to every implementation for a rare scenario (hardware reconfiguration). The nullable mechanism already covers the common cases (EV plug/unplug, sensor temporarily offline).

### DEC-052: Feature-Level Subscription Model

**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Use case YAML definitions listed individual attribute names in their `subscriptions` field (e.g., MPD subscribed only to `acActivePower`). Analysis revealed these lists were incomplete and sometimes incorrect (e.g., COB subscribing to `acActivePower` on a BATTERY endpoint, which only has DC measurements).

The interaction model already supports "subscribe to all" via an empty `attributeIds` array in the Subscribe request. Combined with `minInterval` for batching and delta notifications that only send changed values, feature-level subscription is practical for MASH's target domain (energy devices over TLS/TCP).

**Options Evaluated:**

1. **Fix per-attribute subscription lists:** Keep the current model, make lists complete and endpoint-type-aware in each use case YAML.
2. **Feature-level subscription (subscribe to all):** Use cases declare "subscribe to this feature" without listing individual attributes. Controller subscribes with empty `attributeIds` array. Device pushes all changed attributes.
3. **Hybrid:** Default to subscribe-all, with optional per-attribute overrides for special cases.

**Decision:** Option 2 - Feature-level subscription as default.

**Model:**

- Use case YAML declares `subscribe: all` for features that need push notifications
- Controller sends Subscribe with empty `attributeIds` array (already supported by interaction model)
- Device batches attribute changes within `minInterval` and sends a single delta notification per coalescing window
- Device only sends attributes it has (nullable attributes without values are not pushed)
- `maxInterval` ensures periodic heartbeats for freshness

**Use case YAML change:**

Before:
```yaml
- feature: Measurement
  required: true
  subscriptions:
    - acActivePower
```

After:
```yaml
- feature: Measurement
  required: true
  subscribe: all
```

**Rationale:**

- **Correct by default:** No risk of incomplete subscription lists going stale as features evolve.
- **Simpler YAML:** No need to maintain per-attribute lists that duplicate feature definitions.
- **Efficient on wire:** Delta notifications only send changed values. `minInterval` batches simultaneous changes into one message. A single feature subscription report carries all changed attributes in one CBOR payload.
- **Practical for the domain:** Energy devices over TLS/TCP can handle a few hundred bytes per report. The devices are inverters and EVSEs, not coin-cell sensors.
- **Device controls cadence:** Device decides per-attribute reporting behavior within the `minInterval`/`maxInterval` bounds. Slowly-changing attributes (like `stateOfHealth`) are only sent on change or at `maxInterval` heartbeats.

**Declined Alternatives:**

- **Per-attribute subscription lists (Option 1):** High maintenance burden. Lists were already incorrect. Endpoint-type-dependent requirements make per-use-case lists complex.
- **Hybrid (Option 3):** Adds complexity without clear benefit. The empty-array-means-all mechanism is clean and sufficient.

### DEC-053: Endpoint Type Conformance Registry

**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Feature YAML files define the superset of all possible attributes a feature can have. But not every attribute applies to every endpoint type -- a PV_STRING has no AC measurements, a GRID_CONNECTION has no battery SoC. With DEC-052 adopting feature-level subscriptions, the question becomes: how does a device developer know which attributes are mandatory for their endpoint type? And how is this testable?

The existing `mandatory` field in feature YAML is too coarse: `acActivePower` was marked `mandatory: true` in Measurement, but it's meaningless for DC-only endpoints (PV_STRING, BATTERY).

**Options Evaluated:**

1. **FeatureMap-gated conformance (Matter-style):** Use existing featureMap bits to gate attributes (e.g., `[BATTERY]` makes `stateOfCharge` mandatory). Proven pattern but the bits weren't designed for this granularity.
2. **Endpoint type conformance registry:** Per-endpoint-type mandatory/recommended attribute lists in a dedicated registry file. Most explicit and readable.
3. **Per-feature flags:** Each feature gets its own capability flags (Measurement gets AC, DC, BATT). Clean grouping but adds a second layer of feature flags.
4. **Keep simple, PICS only:** No formalization. Conformance lives in PICS files and human documentation. Simple but not testable from spec alone.

**Decision:** Option 2 - Endpoint type conformance registry with two-layer model.

**Two-layer conformance model:**

| Layer | Defines | Location |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Feature YAML** | The superset of all possible attributes, types, access, units | `docs/features/<feature>/1.0.yaml` |
| **Endpoint type registry** | Per-endpoint-type mandatory/recommended attributes per feature | `docs/features/endpoint-conformance.yaml` |

**Conformance levels:**

- **mandatory:** Must be in `attributeList`. PICS validation fails without it. Value may be `null` per DEC-051.
- **recommended:** Should be in `attributeList` if hardware supports it. PICS validation warns if missing.
- **optional:** Everything else in the feature YAML. Device's choice.

**Example (Measurement feature):**

```yaml
GRID_CONNECTION:
  Measurement:
    mandatory: [acActivePower]
    recommended: [acCurrentPerPhase, acVoltagePerPhase, acFrequency,
                  acEnergyConsumed, acEnergyProduced]

BATTERY:
  Measurement:
    mandatory: [dcPower, stateOfCharge]
    recommended: [dcVoltage, stateOfHealth, temperature,
                  dcEnergyIn, dcEnergyOut]

PV_STRING:
  Measurement:
    mandatory: [dcPower]
    recommended: [dcVoltage, dcCurrent, dcEnergyOut]
```

**Feature YAML changes:**

- The `mandatory` flag in feature YAML now means "mandatory whenever the feature is present on ANY endpoint type" (universal minimum).
- For Measurement, `acActivePower` loses its `mandatory: true` since it's not applicable to DC-only endpoints. The endpoint type registry handles per-type requirements.

**Rationale:**

- **Single source of truth per concern:** Feature YAML defines what's possible. Endpoint type registry defines what's expected.
- **Readable:** A device developer building a BATTERY looks at one place and sees exactly what's required.
- **Testable:** PICS validator and mash-test can verify conformance against the registry.
- **Decoupled:** Feature definitions remain endpoint-agnostic. New endpoint types can be added to the registry without changing feature YAML.
- **Not over-engineered:** Two files, clear relationship, no new runtime mechanisms.

**Declined Alternatives:**

- **FeatureMap gating (Option 1):** featureMap bits are coarse (BATTERY applies cross-feature) and weren't designed for per-attribute conformance. Would require new bits or overloading existing ones.
- **Per-feature flags (Option 3):** Adds conceptual complexity. A second layer of capability flags makes the protocol harder to learn.
- **PICS only (Option 4):** Not testable from spec alone. Conformance knowledge lives in scattered docs rather than a machine-readable registry.

### DEC-054: Endpoint-Aware PICS Format

**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The original PICS code format used device-level feature codes (`MASH.S.CTRL.A01=1`), which is ambiguous for multi-endpoint devices. A hybrid inverter with INVERTER on endpoint 1 and BATTERY on endpoint 2 cannot express per-endpoint conformance. The endpoint type conformance registry (DEC-053) further requires knowing which endpoint type each feature belongs to.

**Options Evaluated:**

1. **Keep device-level codes:** Application features remain at device level. Conformance validation must infer endpoint mapping from device type. Simple but unable to express multi-endpoint devices.
2. **Endpoint-level codes with endpoint type declarations:** PICS codes include an endpoint identifier (`MASH.S.E01.CTRL.A01=1`), with endpoint type declarations (`MASH.S.E01=INVERTER`). Enables per-endpoint conformance validation.
3. **Separate PICS files per endpoint:** One PICS file per endpoint. Clean separation but complicates tooling and loses the single-document overview.

**Decision:** Option 2 - Endpoint-level codes with endpoint type declarations.

**Format:**

```
MASH.<Side>[.E<hex><hex>][.<Feature>][.<Type><ID>][.<Qualifier>]
```

- Endpoint IDs are two hex digits: `E01`, `E02`, ..., `EFF`
- Endpoint type declarations: `MASH.S.E01=INVERTER`
- Application feature codes are endpoint-scoped: `MASH.S.E01.CTRL.A01=1`
- Transport/pairing codes remain device-level: `MASH.S.TRANS=1`, `MASH.S.COMM=1`
- `MASH.S.ENDPOINTS` is derived from the count of `MASH.S.E<xx>=<type>` declarations

**Application features (must be endpoint-scoped):**
ELEC, MEAS, CTRL, STAT, INFO, CHRG, SIG, TAR, PLAN

**Pairing/connection features (remain device-level):**
TRANS, COMM, CERT, ZONE, CONN, FAILSAFE, SUB, DURATION, DISC

**Example (multi-endpoint device):**

```
MASH.S=1

# Endpoint declarations
MASH.S.E01=INVERTER
MASH.S.E02=BATTERY

# Endpoint 1: Inverter with Measurement + EnergyControl
MASH.S.E01.MEAS.A01=1       # acActivePower
MASH.S.E01.CTRL.A01=1       # deviceType
MASH.S.E01.CTRL.A02=1       # controlState

# Endpoint 2: Battery with Measurement + EnergyControl
MASH.S.E02.MEAS.A28=1       # dcPower
MASH.S.E02.MEAS.A32=1       # stateOfCharge
MASH.S.E02.CTRL.A01=1       # deviceType
MASH.S.E02.CTRL.A02=1       # controlState
```

**Rationale:**

- **Precise per-endpoint conformance:** Enables EPT-001 rule to validate mandatory attributes per endpoint type against DEC-053 registry.
- **Multi-endpoint expressible:** A hybrid inverter/battery can declare both endpoint types with distinct feature sets.
- **Backward compatible in practice:** Transport/pairing codes are unchanged. The new endpoint segment only affects application features.
- **Consistent with device model:** MASH uses Device > Endpoint > Feature hierarchy. PICS codes now mirror this structure.

**Declined Alternatives:**

- **Device-level codes (Option 1):** Cannot express multi-endpoint devices. Conformance validation would require guessing endpoint mappings.
- **Separate files (Option 3):** Overcomplicates tooling. Most devices have 1-2 endpoints; a single file with clear endpoint prefixes is sufficient.

**Impact:**

- All PICS test data files updated to endpoint format
- Parser updated to extract endpoint ID from codes
- All validation rules (MAN, DEP, CMD, EPT) iterate per endpoint
- PICS `Code` struct gains `EndpointID` field; `PICS` struct gains `Endpoints` map

### DEC-055: Use Cases on the Wire

**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** MASH treats use cases as controller-side inference: the controller probes features, builds a capability profile, and locally matches against a use case registry. This has three problems: (1) no business logic testing -- conformance tests verify protocol behavior ("SetLimit returns success") but not use case behavior ("failsafe engages on heartbeat timeout"), (2) no explicit contract -- a device never declares its behavioral commitments, and (3) unnecessary probing cost (~34 Read round-trips to discover what could be a single attribute).

Matter solves this with `DeviceTypeList` on every endpoint (explicit declaration) plus a Device Library Specification (behavioral requirements). EEBUS solves it with `NodeManagement.UseCaseInformation` plus per-use-case test specifications. EEBUS's core weakness is independent release of use cases and test specs, creating a combinatorial compatibility matrix.

**Design Constraints:**

- **Bundled releases:** Everything ships together under `specVersion`. Use case versions do not float independently. This is the primary lesson from EEBUS.
- **REST API versioning model:** Use case contracts must be forward-compatible within a major version. Breaking changes require a new major version (a new contract).
- **Controller version spread:** Controllers talk to devices on different specVersions simultaneously. A controller must handle LPC 1.0 devices and LPC 1.1 devices without branching on specVersion.

**Options Evaluated:**

1. **Use case names only (no version on wire):** Device declares names + endpointId. `specVersion` implicitly determines the use case contract version. Simplest wire format.
2. **Use case names with major.minor version:** Device declares name + major + minor + endpointId. Version follows REST API compatibility rules: minor = forward-compatible, major = new contract.
3. **No wire changes (tests only):** Keep use cases as controller-side inference. Add behavioral test suites selected via PICS files.

**Decision:** Option 2 -- Use case names with major.minor version on the wire.

**Wire Format:**

New `useCases` attribute (id 21) on DeviceInfo (endpoint 0):

```
UseCaseDecl struct (CBOR integer keys):
  1: endpointId  uint8    which endpoint implements this use case
  2: name        string   e.g. "LPC"
  3: major       uint8    contract version (breaking changes)
  4: minor       uint8    contract version (compatible refinements)
```

Example:
```cbor
useCases: [
  {1: 1, 2: "LPC", 3: 1, 4: 0},
  {1: 1, 2: "EVC", 3: 1, 4: 0}
]
```

**Versioning Rules:**

- **Minor increment:** Forward-compatible changes only. Tighter timing, new optional behaviors, clarifications, additional optional attributes. Any controller handling major X works with any minor within that major.
- **Major increment:** Breaking changes to the behavioral contract. Different state machine structure, removed mandatory behavior, changed semantics. A device may declare both the old and new major version during a transition period. Old controllers match the old major; new controllers prefer the new one.
- **Bundling:** Each `specVersion` release defines which use case versions are available. A device on specVersion 1.0 declares use case versions from the 1.0 manifest. Use case versions never float independently.

**Use Case YAML Changes:**

```yaml
name: LPC
fullName: Limit Power Consumption
specVersion: "1.0"
major: 1
minor: 0
```

**Rationale:**

*Why not names only (Option 1):* A controller talking to devices on different specVersions needs to know which behavioral contract applies. Without the version on the wire, the controller must maintain a specVersion-to-use-case-version mapping table and branch accordingly. With the version on the wire, the contract is self-describing. The minor version also enables precise test selection without ambiguity.

*Why not tests only (Option 3):* Does not solve the explicit contract problem (device never declares intent) or the probing cost problem (~34 reads). Test selection depends on external PICS files rather than self-describing devices.

*Why major.minor matches protocol versioning:* Consistency. The protocol already uses major.minor for specVersion with identical semantics (major = breaking, minor = additive). Using the same model for use cases makes the versioning story uniform across the protocol.

*Why REST API model:* Controllers in the real world handle devices on different versions simultaneously, just like API servers handle clients on different versions. Forward compatibility within a major version means controllers don't need per-minor branching logic. Breaking changes get a new major, which the device can declare alongside the old one for graceful migration.

**Declined Alternatives:**

- **Per-use-case revision without major/minor (single integer):** No way to distinguish compatible refinements from breaking changes. Controllers must treat every revision bump as potentially breaking.
- **Version in the name string ("LPC/v1"):** Unusual for a binary protocol. Structured fields are more consistent with the rest of the wire format and enable numeric comparison.
- **Independent use case releases:** The EEBUS path. Creates combinatorial compatibility matrix. Rejected by design constraint.

**Impact:**

- DeviceInfo gains `useCases` attribute (id 21, mandatory, readOnly)
- Use case YAML files gain `major` and `minor` fields
- `mash-ucgen` generates registry with version information
- `mash-test` reads `useCases` from device to select test suites (version-aware)
- `protocol-versions.yaml` version manifest expands to include use case versions per release
- DEC-050 (feature versioning) is unaffected -- features continue using `attributeList` for capability discovery

### DEC-056: Controller-Side Use Case Declarations

**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** DEC-055 added device-side `useCases` declarations to DeviceInfo so that devices explicitly declare which use cases they support. Controllers are also MASH devices with DeviceInfo. They should declare which use cases they support as a client.

**Decision:** Controllers populate `useCases` with `EndpointID: 0` to indicate client-side support. Same `UseCaseDecl` wire format. Version comes from the use case registry.

Example for a CEM supporting all 11 use cases:
```cbor
useCases: [
  {1: 0, 2: 0x01, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 0x07},  // LPC, scenarios BASE+MEAS+OVERRIDE
  {1: 0, 2: 0x02, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 0x07},  // LPP
  {1: 0, 2: 0x03, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 0x07},  // MPD
  {1: 0, 2: 0x04, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 0x3F},  // EVC (6 scenarios)
  {1: 0, 2: 0x05, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 0x07},  // COB
  ...
]
```

**Rationale:**

- **Symmetric:** Both sides of the protocol are explicit. Devices declare what they implement; controllers declare what they can control.
- **Testable:** Enables controller conformance testing. A test harness can read the controller's `useCases` to determine which test suites to run.
- **Discoverable:** A device can read the controller's capabilities during connection setup, enabling smarter negotiation.
- **No new types:** Reuses `UseCaseDecl` exactly as defined in DEC-055. No wire format changes.

**Declined Alternatives:**

- **Separate attribute for controller capabilities:** Adds unnecessary complexity. The `EndpointID: 0` convention naturally distinguishes client-side from server-side declarations.
- **Implicit from feature probing:** The same problem DEC-055 solved for devices applies to controllers -- inference is fragile and costly.

**Impact:**

- `EvaluateController()` function added to `pkg/usecase/evaluate.go`
- CEM example populates `useCases` in its DeviceInfo
- No changes to wire format, ucgen generator, or discovery code

### DEC-057: Integer Use Case IDs and Scenario Bitmaps

**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** DEC-055 introduced use case declarations on the wire using string names (e.g., `"LPC"`). While functional, this was inconsistent with the rest of MASH where all identifiers (feature types, endpoint types, command IDs) are integers. Additionally, use cases had no way to express which optional scenarios a device supports -- everything was a flat list of features with required/optional flags.

**Options Evaluated:**
1. **Keep string names, add separate scenario field** -- Minimal change, but string names waste wire bytes and are inconsistent.
2. **Integer IDs only** -- Compact and consistent, but doesn't address the optional scenario problem.
3. **Integer IDs + scenario bitmap** (chosen) -- Compact wire format, consistent with MASH conventions, and introduces atomic scenario contracts inspired by Matter's FeatureMap.

**Decision:** Replace string use case names with `uint16` IDs on the wire and add a `uint32` scenario bitmap to `UseCaseDecl`. Each use case defines named scenarios (BASE at bit 0, plus optional scenarios at bits 1+). Declaring a scenario is atomic -- all features in a scenario are present or none are.

Wire format change:
```cbor
// Before (DEC-055):
{1: endpointId, 2: "LPC",  3: 1, 4: 0}

// After (DEC-057):
{1: endpointId, 2: 0x01, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 0x03}
//                 ^^^^                  ^^^^
//              uint16 ID          scenario bitmap (BASE + MEASUREMENT)
```

Scenario structure (example LPC):
- Bit 0 (BASE): EnergyControl(limits) + Electrical(maxConsumption) -- always required
- Bit 1 (MEASUREMENT): Measurement feature -- optional
- Bit 2 (OVERRIDE): Override tracking -- optional

**Rationale:**

- **Consistency:** All other MASH identifiers use integers. String names were the only exception.
- **Compactness:** `uint16` is 2-3 bytes vs 3-5+ bytes for a string name. At 11 use cases per controller, this saves 30+ bytes per declaration set.
- **Matter-inspired:** The scenario bitmap follows the same pattern as Matter's FeatureMap -- a single uint32 tells you exactly which optional capabilities are present.
- **Atomic contracts:** No ambiguity about partial scenarios. If bit 1 is set, all features in scenario 1 must be present. This eliminates the O/M/C complexity that plagued EEBUS.
- **Testable:** PICS validation can check per-scenario: BASE features produce errors if missing; non-BASE features produce errors only if the scenario is declared.

**Impact:**

- `UseCaseDecl` wire format: key 2 changes from string to uint16, key 5 added (uint32 scenarios)
- `UseCaseDef` restructured: `Features []FeatureRequirement` replaced by `Scenarios []ScenarioDef`
- Code generator (`mash-ucgen`): emits scenario-structured registry with `IDToName`/`NameToID` maps
- Matcher: evaluates per-scenario independently; BASE must match for use case to match
- PICS: generates per-scenario codes (`MASH.S.UC.LPC.S00`, `MASH.S.UC.LPC.S01`, etc.)
- All 11 use case YAMLs restructured with `scenarios:` sections
- Breaking wire change -- justified since protocol is pre-1.0

**Declined Alternatives:**

- **String names with scenario field:** Inconsistent with integer-based ID convention used everywhere else in MASH. More bytes on the wire for no benefit.
- **Flat feature list with per-feature optionality flags:** This is what EEBUS does (O/M/C per use case element). It creates combinatorial explosion in testing and ambiguous partial support states.
- **Per-scenario separate declarations:** One `UseCaseDecl` per scenario would be cleaner in some ways but wastes wire space and complicates deduplication.

### DEC-058: Capability Snapshots in Protocol Logs

**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** Proposed

**Context:** On long-lived TLS/TCP connections, device capability metadata -- endpoints, features, use cases, scenarios, featureMap, attributeList -- is exchanged once at connection establishment and never repeated. If protocol logs are rotated, truncated, or begin recording mid-session, the initial discovery data is lost. A log analyst can no longer determine what the remote device supports, making the remaining log data difficult to interpret.

This is a known pain point from EEBUS/SPINE, where `NodeManagementDetailedDiscovery` is exchanged once and then relied upon for the life of the connection. Matter mitigates this incidentally through UDP-forced re-subscriptions (priming reports every MaxInterval), but this is a transport artifact, not a deliberate observability mechanism. MASH's reliable TCP transport means connections can persist for days or weeks without re-exchanging capabilities.

The problem affects both sides of the connection and is compounded by the fact that third-party devices control their own logging -- we cannot mandate log retention policies.

**Options Evaluated:**
1. **Protocol-level metadata snapshot message** -- New control message type emitted periodically on the wire.
2. **Enhanced subscription heartbeats** -- Include global attributes (featureMap, attributeList) in every heartbeat notification.
3. **Capability inference from partial logs** -- Offline tool that reconstructs capabilities from protocol traffic patterns.
4. **Capability snapshots in protocol logs** (chosen) -- Periodic log events containing complete device model snapshots, with a configurable hybrid trigger policy.

**Decision:** Add a logging-layer capability snapshot mechanism. The application configures a `SnapshotPolicy` on the stack with three parameters: `MaxInterval` (time trigger), `MaxMessages` (message count trigger), and `MinMessages` (floor for the time trigger). A snapshot is emitted when either `MaxMessages` is reached or `MaxInterval` elapses with at least `MinMessages` logged since the last snapshot. An initial snapshot always fires at session establishment.

Each snapshot contains the complete device model of both the local device and the connected remote peer (endpoints, features, featureMap, attributeList, commandList, use cases, scenarios).

```go
type SnapshotPolicy struct {
    MaxInterval time.Duration  // Time trigger (fires only if MinMessages met)
    MaxMessages int            // Message count trigger (fires unconditionally)
    MinMessages int            // Floor for time trigger (prevents snapshot spam on idle connections)
}

// Default: 30 min / 1000 messages / 50 message floor
```

The hybrid trigger with MinMessages floor ensures:
- Busy connections (high log growth, high rotation risk): frequent snapshots proportional to traffic
- Normal connections: periodic snapshots at MaxInterval
- Near-idle connections (few messages, low rotation risk): time trigger suppressed, snapshots only at MaxMessages
- Idle connections: initial snapshot only

**Rationale:**

- **Logging-layer, not protocol-layer:** The problem is about log observability, not protocol correctness. No wire overhead, no spec change required, no impact on third-party implementations.
- **Hybrid trigger:** Pure time-based triggers waste log space on idle connections. Pure count-based triggers miss idle connections entirely. The hybrid with MinMessages floor adapts the snapshot frequency to the actual forensic risk.
- **Both sides included:** Each snapshot contains local + remote capabilities. On the controller side, remote data is cached after initial discovery reads (free due to DEC-051 immutability). On the device side, remote data is populated from commissioning certificate info and any exposed controller model.
- **Negligible overhead:** A typical snapshot is 400-600 bytes CBOR. With default policy, busy connections produce ~22 KB/hour of snapshot data; quiet connections produce near zero.

**Impact:**

- New `SnapshotPolicy` struct in `pkg/service/types.go`, added to `DeviceConfig` and `ControllerConfig`
- New `snapshotTracker` in `pkg/service/snapshot_tracker.go` embedded in ZoneSession and DeviceSession
- New `CategorySnapshot` and `CapabilitySnapshotEvent` types in `pkg/log/event.go`
- Controller reads full remote device capabilities after commissioning/reconnection (extends existing `checkDeviceVersion` pattern)
- `mash-log` tool extended: snapshot display in `view`, snapshot statistics in `stats`, `--annotate` flag for human-readable ID resolution

**Declined Alternatives:**

- **Protocol-level metadata snapshot message (option 1):** Requires a spec change affecting all implementations. The problem is about log forensics, not protocol behavior. Wire overhead is unnecessary when the data is already in memory locally.
- **Enhanced subscription heartbeats (option 2):** Per-feature only -- no single message captures the full device model. Doesn't include endpoint structure or use case declarations. The current implementation already includes global attributes in subscribe-all heartbeats (DEC-052).
- **Capability inference from partial logs (option 3):** Best-effort only. Cannot discover endpoints/features with no traffic. Cannot reconstruct use case declarations or device identity. High implementation complexity for uncertain results. May be valuable as a supplementary tool but not as the primary solution.
- **Sidecar index file:** A `.mlog.idx` file that stores the latest snapshot per connection. Useful optimization for log rotation scenarios but not needed as the primary mechanism.

**Context:** Need to define error response format.

**Questions:**
- Error codes taxonomy
- Retry semantics
- Connection error vs command error

---

### OPEN-004: Version Negotiation (RESOLVED)

**Resolution:** Addressed by DEC-050 (Protocol Versioning Strategy).

**Context:** SPINE lacks version negotiation, causing interop issues.

**Questions:**
- How to negotiate protocol version?
- How to handle feature version mismatches?
- Backwards compatibility strategy

---

### OPEN-005: Discovery Details

**Context:** mDNS/DNS-SD for discovery, QR code for commissioning.

**Questions:**
- mDNS TXT record format
- Service type naming
- QR code content format (like Matter's setup payload?)

## Research Notes

### Matter Protocol Insights

**Source:** [Matter Documentation](https://project-chip.github.io/connectedhomeip-doc/)

Key learnings:
- Matter has 4 interaction types: Read, Write, Subscribe, Invoke
- Clusters are well-defined with mandatory/optional attributes
- Server is stateful, Client is stateless
- Events are timestamped journal entries (not just current state)

### EEBUS Failure Analysis

**Source:** ship-go and spine-go analysis documents

Key learnings:
- 50+ specification ambiguities in SHIP alone
- 7,000+ potential RFE combinations create testing nightmare
- "Appropriate client" never defined - security hole
- No test specifications or reference implementations
- Double connection "most recent" rule causes race conditions

## Revision History

| Date | Changes |
|------|---------|
| 2025-01-24 | Initial creation with first decisions |
| 2025-01-25 | Added DEC-026: EnergyControl feature design (capability-first, forecast-optional) |
| 2025-01-25 | Added DEC-027: Feature separation (Electrical, Measurement, EnergyControl) with per-phase current limits and phase mapping |
| 2025-01-25 | Added DEC-028: Setpoints and V2H phase balancing - SetSetpoint, SetCurrentSetpoints commands, AsymmetricSupportEnum |
| 2025-01-25 | Added DEC-029: Measurement feature (comprehensive AC/DC) and EndpointType enum for multi-component devices |
| 2025-01-25 | Added DEC-030: Status feature for per-endpoint operating state (separates observation from control) |
| 2025-01-25 | Added DEC-031: DeviceInfo feature with IANA PEN-based deviceId, complete device structure in single read |
| 2025-01-25 | Added DEC-032: ChargingSession feature for EV charging with ISO 15118 support |
| 2025-01-25 | Added DEC-033: Signals + Tariff + Plan features for ToUT, POEN, CEVC, forecasts. Direction-based split: Signals (IN), Plan (OUT), Tariff (structure) |
| 2025-01-25 | Added DEC-034: Explicit ControlStateEnum and ProcessStateEnum - replaces implicit heartbeat-based state inference with explicit device-reported state. Universal across LPC, EVSE, battery, heat pump. Adds failsafe config and OptionalProcess for OHPCF-style task scheduling. |
| 2025-01-25 | Added DEC-035: Matter-style capability discovery with global attributes (featureMap, attributeList, acceptedCommandList). Defines 11 feature flags for optional capability sets. Enables self-describing devices without trial-and-error attribute reading. |
| 2025-01-25 | Added DEC-036: Charging mode and responsibility model. ChargingModeEnum for optimization strategy (PV surplus, price optimized). "CEM suggests, EVSE decides" pattern with start/stop delays. Covers OSCEV 2.0 use cases. |
| 2025-01-25 | Updated DEC-036: Electrical feature is dynamic - reflects current system capability including connected devices (e.g., EV). No separate EV constraint fields needed; Electrical updates when EV connects. Clean two-layer model: Electrical (capability) + EnergyControl (policy). |
| 2025-01-25 | Added DEC-037: Two-level capability discovery. FeatureMap is 32-bit bitmap (aligned with Matter) for high-level category checks. Detailed capabilities in feature attributes (supportsAsymmetric, supportedDirections, supportedChargingModes). Pattern: featureMap for quick check, attributes for specifics. |
| 2025-01-25 | Added DEC-038: Command parameters vs stored attributes. Duration, cause are transient command parameters (like Matter), not stored attributes (unlike EEBUS). No "remaining duration" attribute. |
| 2025-01-25 | Added DEC-039: State machine interaction rules. Process continues during FAILSAFE, scheduled processes start as planned, PAUSED behavior is device-specific (PICS). Connection loss detection max 95s, failsafe timer accuracy +/- 1%. |
| 2026-01-28 | Added DEC-044: Message correlation via MessageID, 32-bit ID rationale, 10-second request timeout. Documents implicit ACK/NACK model (response status = ack) and MessageID wraparound behavior. |
| 2026-01-28 | Added DEC-045: Transport-layer heartbeat sufficient for failsafe. No application-layer heartbeats needed. Analyzes EEBUS LPC/LPP redundant heartbeat design, Matter's approach, and why command arrival itself proves controller liveness. |
| 2026-01-29 | Added DEC-047: Commissioning security hardening. Zone-based connection model, PASE attempt backoff, nonce binding for renewal, generic error responses, handshake timeout. |
| 2026-01-29 | Added DEC-048: Commissioning window duration alignment. Default 15 minutes (was 3 hours), min 3 minutes (was 1 hour), max 3 hours (was 24 hours). Aligns with Matter 5.4.2.3.1. |
| 2026-01-30 | Added DEC-050: Protocol versioning strategy. Single protocol version (major.minor) on the wire via ALPN + specVersion. Removes per-feature clusterRevision. Feature revisions tracked in spec as version manifest per release. Resolves OPEN-004. |
| 2026-01-31 | Added DEC-051: Static attributeList immutability. attributeList is immutable for connection lifetime. Unavailable data uses null values, not structural changes. |
| 2026-01-31 | Added DEC-052: Feature-level subscription model. Use cases default to subscribe-all for features. Replaces incomplete per-attribute subscription lists.
| 2026-01-31 | Added DEC-054: Endpoint-aware PICS format. Application feature codes scoped to endpoints (`MASH.S.E01.CTRL.A01`). Transport/pairing codes unchanged. Enables per-endpoint conformance validation. |
| 2026-01-31 | Added DEC-053: Endpoint type conformance registry. Two-layer model: feature YAML defines superset, endpoint type registry defines per-type mandatory/recommended attributes. |
| 2026-01-31 | Added DEC-055: Use cases on the wire. Adds `useCases` attribute to DeviceInfo with name + major.minor version + endpointId. REST API versioning model: minor = forward-compatible, major = new contract. Bundled with specVersion releases. Enables business logic testing and explicit device contracts. |
| 2026-02-01 | Added DEC-057: Integer use case IDs and scenario bitmaps. Replaces string names with uint16 IDs on the wire. Adds uint32 scenario bitmap to UseCaseDecl. Matter-inspired atomic scenario contracts. All 11 use case YAMLs restructured with scenarios. |
| 2026-02-02 | Added DEC-058: Capability snapshots in protocol logs. Logging-layer mechanism to periodically emit device model snapshots with hybrid time/count trigger and MinMessages floor. Addresses discovery data loss on long-lived connections. |
