## 1. Executive Summary

| | **MASH** | **Matter 1.5** | **EEBUS (SHIP/SPINE)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Energy device management | General-purpose IoT + energy | Energy device communication |
| **Design philosophy** | Minimal, deterministic | Broad interoperability | Maximum flexibility |
| **Specification size** | Single spec (~100 pages) | 3 specs (~3,000+ pages) | 2 specs + use case docs (~1,000+ pages) |
| **First energy features** | Core design goal | Added in 1.3, expanded in 1.5 | Original purpose |
| **Target devices** | Energy equipment (EVSE, inverter, heat pump, battery) | All consumer IoT including energy | Energy equipment |
| **Organization** | Open source | CSA (Connectivity Standards Alliance) | EEBus Initiative e.V. |

**Key takeaway:** Matter 1.5 has significantly expanded its energy management capabilities (EVSE, DEM, pricing, metering), but still lacks critical features for European energy management: phase-specific limits, controller-driven power curtailment, regulatory grid operator integration, and full bidirectional charging control. MASH occupies a distinct niche: purpose-built for energy with Matter-inspired architecture but dramatically lower complexity than either.

## 3. Device / Data Model

### 3.1 Hierarchy Comparison

| Level | MASH | Matter 1.5 | EEBUS (SPINE) |
|-------|------|------------|---------------|
| Level 1 | **Device** | **Node** | **Device** |
| Level 2 | **Endpoint** | **Endpoint** | **Entity** (with sub-entities) |
| Level 3 | **Feature** | **Cluster** | **Feature** (with Functions) |
| Level 4 | Attribute / Command | Attribute / Command / Event | Function (with Elements) |

### 3.2 Key Differences

**MASH:**
- Flat endpoint list (no nesting)
- EndpointType enum defines semantics (EV_CHARGER, INVERTER, BATTERY, etc.)
- Topology implicit from EndpointType
- 9 core features covering all energy use cases
- Feature IDs are 16-bit integers

**Matter 1.5:**
- Endpoints can compose via Descriptor cluster's PartsList (tree structure)
- Device Types define required/optional clusters per endpoint
- Explicit composition patterns (e.g., EVSE is always endpoint composition)
- Multiple energy-specific clusters added in 1.3-1.5
- Cluster IDs are 32-bit integers

**EEBUS (SPINE):**
- Entities can nest arbitrarily (entity hierarchy)
- EntityType and FeatureType define device structure
- Features have roles (client/server/special)
- Functions are the atomic data unit within features
- Addresses are multi-level: device/entity[]/feature
- 50+ standard classes (feature types)

### 3.3 Addressing

```
MASH:     deviceId / endpointId / featureId / attribute
          evse-001 / 1 / Measurement / acActivePower

Matter:   nodeId / endpointId / clusterId / attributeId
          (integer IDs at each level)

EEBUS:    device / entity[] / feature / function
          evse-001 / [0,1] / Measurement / powerDescription
```

| Interval control | minInterval / maxInterval | MinIntervalFloor / MaxIntervalCeiling (negotiated) | No interval parameters |
| Persistence | Lost on disconnect | Lost on session termination | Persistent (stored on both sides) |
| Binding (separate) | No (unified with subscribe) | No | Yes (binding = ownership, subscription = notification) |
| Max subscriptions | Per-connection limit | Per-node limit (3 per fabric min) | Implementation-defined |

### 4.3 Message Overhead Example

Approximate message sizes for reading a power measurement value:

| Protocol | Request | Response | Encoding |
|----------|---------|----------|----------|
| MASH | ~40 bytes | ~60 bytes | CBOR with integer keys |

Matter:  Commissioner ──(various)──► Node
         Multiple sessions possible (PASE for commissioning, CASE for operational)
         MRP sessions maintain state over UDP, TCP connections are persistent

EEBUS:   Node A ◄──WebSocket/TLS──► Node B (either side can initiate)
         Double-connection race condition when both sides connect simultaneously
         Requires connection de-duplication logic
```

|--------|------|------------|--------------|
| PAKE protocol | SPAKE2+ | SPAKE2+ (PASE) | None (SKI-based trust) |
| Setup code | 8-digit (~27 bits) | 8-digit (27 bits) | SKI (Subject Key Identifier) |
| Setup code delivery | QR code | QR code / NFC / manual | Display / manual / QR code |
| Session establishment | SPAKE2+ then TLS with Op Cert | PASE (commissioning) then CASE (operational) | TLS handshake + SKI verification + trust negotiation |

## 7. Discovery

### 7.1 Network Discovery

| Aspect | MASH | Matter 1.5 | EEBUS (SHIP) |
|--------|------|------------|--------------|
| Protocol | mDNS/DNS-SD | mDNS/DNS-SD | mDNS/DNS-SD |

## 8. Multi-Controller Support

### 8.1 Architecture

| Aspect | MASH | Matter 1.5 | EEBUS |
|--------|------|------------|-------|
| Concept | Multi-zone (up to 5 zones) | Multi-fabric (up to 5 fabrics typical) | Multi-connection (no explicit limit) |
| Priority model | Zone types with fixed priority (GRID > LOCAL > TEST) | No built-in priority; ACL per fabric | No built-in priority; application-level |
| Conflict resolution | Per-feature: limits = most restrictive wins, setpoints = highest priority wins | Application-level (no framework) | Not defined in spec |
| Independent certificates | Yes (separate Zone CA per zone) | Yes (separate RCAC per fabric) | Yes (separate SKI per connection) |
| Connections per device | Up to max_zones + 1 | Multiple sessions (fabric-limited) | Implementation-defined |

### 8.2 Priority Resolution (MASH-specific)

MASH is the only protocol of the three with built-in priority-based conflict resolution for energy management:

```
Zone Priority:
  GRID (1) > LOCAL (2) > TEST (3)

Resolution Rules:
  LIMITS:    min(all zone limits)          -- most restrictive wins
  SETPOINTS: highest_priority_zone_value   -- priority wins
```

Matter and EEBUS leave conflict resolution to application-level implementation.

## 9. Energy Management Coverage

### 9.1 Feature/Cluster Mapping

| Energy Domain | MASH Features | Matter 1.5 Clusters | EEBUS Use Cases |
|---------------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Device identity** | DeviceInfo | Basic Information, Descriptor | DeviceClassification, NetworkManagement |
| **Operating state** | Status | State attributes within device-specific clusters (e.g., EVSE) | Status-specific functions per use case |
| **Electrical config** | Electrical | No direct equivalent | ElectricalConnection |
| **Power measurement** | Measurement | Electrical Power Measurement | Measurement (via MPC, MGCP, MOB, MOI, MPS) |
| **Energy measurement** | Measurement | Electrical Energy Measurement | Measurement |
| **Load/production control** | EnergyControl | Device Energy Management (PowerAdjustment) | LPC, LPP |
| **Battery control** | EnergyControl (on BATTERY endpoint) | Device Energy Management (on battery device) | COB |
| **EV charging** | ChargingSession + EnergyControl | Energy EVSE + Energy EVSE Mode | CEVC + OSCEV + OPEV + DBEVC |
| **Tariff/pricing** | Tariff | Commodity Price + Commodity Tariff | IncentiveTable (via ITPCM) |
| **Grid signals** | Signals (PRICE, CONSTRAINT, FORECAST) | Commodity Price (partial) | ToUT + POEN + ITPCM |
| **Device plan/forecast** | Plan | Device Energy Management (forecast) | Power sequences (via SPINE) |
| **Heat pump flexibility** | EnergyControl (processState) | Device Energy Management | OHPCF |
| **Water heater** | (future) | Water Heater Management | (not standardized) |
| **Metering** | Measurement (on SUB_METER/GRID_CONNECTION) | Commodity Metering | MGCP |
| **V2X (vehicle-to-grid)** | EnergyControl (V2X feature bit) | Energy EVSE (V2X feature) | DBEVC + OSCEV |

### 9.2 Energy-Specific Cluster Count

| Protocol | Energy-related features/clusters | Total features/clusters in spec |
|----------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| MASH | 9 features (all energy-focused) | 9 + vendor extensions |
| Matter 1.5 | ~10 energy clusters | Dozens of clusters total |
| EEBUS | 50+ classes (all energy-focused) | 50+ classes |

### 9.3 Coverage Gaps

**MASH gaps vs Matter 1.5:**
- No water heater management (planned)
- No commodity metering cluster equivalent (Measurement covers basic metering)

**MASH gaps vs EEBUS:**
- No historical time-series data
- No HVAC-specific use cases (planned)
- Fewer smart appliance use cases (washing machine, dishwasher, etc.)

**Matter 1.5 gaps vs MASH:**
- No built-in multi-controller priority resolution
- No explicit state machine for control states (AUTONOMOUS, CONTROLLED, LIMITED, FAILSAFE)
- More complex commissioning (multi-step PASE+CASE vs 5 steps)
- No domain-specific zone types (GRID, LOCAL, TEST)

**Matter 1.5 gaps vs EEBUS:**
- No phase-specific current limits (EEBUS OPEV supports independent per-phase current limits for circuit overload protection)
- No controller-driven power curtailment (DEM is device-flexibility-oriented; EEBUS LPC/LPP allows controller to set consumption/production limits directly)
- No equivalent to EEBUS's cascading limit architecture (LPC instance 1 + instance 2)
- No grid operator integration (EEBUS supports regulatory grid limits e.g. German section 14a EnWG via grid operator LPC instances)
- Limited bidirectional charging control (V2X feature bit exists but lacks production-side limits and discharge scheduling depth of EEBUS DBEVC)
- No PV surplus charging workflow (EEBUS OSCEV provides optimization for self-consumption from solar production)

**EEBUS gaps vs both:**
- No modern PAKE commissioning (SKI-based trust only)
- No built-in multi-controller conflict resolution
- WebSocket+JSON is heavier than CBOR or TLV on constrained devices
- Double-connection race condition still present
- Persistent subscriptions complicate reconnection scenarios
